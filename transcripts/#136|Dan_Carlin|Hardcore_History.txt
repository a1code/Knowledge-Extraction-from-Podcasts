The following is a conversation with Dan Carlin, host of hardcore history and common sense podcasts. To me, hardcore history is one of, if not the greatest podcast ever made. Dan and Joe Rogan are probably the two main people who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting as a fan and eventually as a podcast or myself meeting Dan was surreal to me. He was not just a mere human like the rest of us. Since his voice has been a guide through some of the darkest moments of human history.
For me, meeting him was like meeting Genghis Khan, Stalin, Hitler, Alexander the Great and all of the most powerful leaders in history, all at once in a crappy hotel room in the middle of Oregon. It turns out that he is, in fact, just the human and truly one of the good ones. This was a pleasure and an honor for me. Quick mention of his sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. First is athletic greens, the all in one drink that I start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases.
Second is simply save a home security company. I used to monitor and protect my apartment. Third is magic spoon, low carb friendly cereal that I think is delicious. And finally catch up the app. I used to send money to friends for food and drinks. Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I think we are living through one of the most challenging moments in American history.
To me, the way out is the reason and love. Both require a deep understanding of human nature and of human history. This conversation is about both. I am perhaps hopelessly optimistic about our future, but if indeed we stand at the precipice of the great filter, watching our world consumed by fire, think of this little podcast conversation as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse.

I do a few minutes of ads now and no ads in the middle. I try to make this interesting, but I give you timestamps. So if you do skip, please still check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the description. it is the best way to support this podcast. This show is sponsored by Athletic Greens, the only one daily drink to support better health and peak performance, a completely replace the multivitamin for me and went far beyond that was 75 vitamins and minerals.
I do intermittent fasting of 16 to 24 hours every day and always break my fast with athletic greens. I can not say enough good things about these guys. It helps me not worry whether I am getting all the nutrients I need. One of the many reasons I am a fan is that they keep iterating on their formula. I love continuous improvement. Life is not about reaching perfection. I think it is about constantly striving for it and making sure each iteration is a positive delta.
The other thing I have taken for a long time outside of athletic greens is fish oil. Some especially excited now that they are selling fish oil and are offering listeners of this podcast Free Month's Supply of Wild Caught a Mega Three Fish Oil. When you go to athletic Mint.com Slash Glassworks to claim the special offer, click the athletic green dot com slash leks link in the description to get the fish oil and the only one supplement I rely on for nutritional foundation of my physical and mental performance.
This show is also sponsored by Simply Save a Home Security Company.

This episode also sponsored by Magic Spoon, low carb killer friendly cereal. I have been on a mix of Kiddo Carnivore diet for a long time now. That means very little carbs. I do, unfortunately, on a rare occasion, binge cherries or blueberries or apples or pairs and definitely regret it later, but love it in the moment, just like I used to regret eating cereal because most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar, which is terrible for you.
But Magic Spoon is a totally new thing. Zero sugar, eleven grams of protein and only three net grams of carbs. I personally like to celebrate little accomplishments and productivity with a snack of magic spoon. It feels like a cheap meal, but it is not. It tastes delicious. It has many flavors, including cocoa, fruity, frosted and blueberry. I tried all of them and they are all delicious. But if you know what is good for you, you will go with cocoa.
My favorite flavor and the flavor of champions.

Finally, the shows presented by Kashyap, the number one finance app in the App Store, when you get it, it collects podcast, catch up, let us you send money to friends, buy bitcoin and invest in the stock market was little as one dollar.
I am thinking of doing more conversations with folks who work in and around the cryptocurrency space similar to I, but even more so. There are a lot of charlatans in the space, but there are also a lot of free thinkers and technical geniuses that are worth exploring in depth and with care. This is a good moment to bring up that. If I make mistakes and get selection and details in conversation, I will keep trying to improve correct where I can and also keep following my curiosity wherever it takes me.
So again, if you get cash out from the App Store or Google Play and use the Collects podcast, you get ten dollars in cash. Apple also donate ten dollars. The first, an organization that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. And now here is my conversation with Dan Carlin. let us start with the highest philosophical question do you think human beings are fundamentally good or are all of us capable of both good and evil?
And it is the environment that molds how we see the trajectory that we take the life. How do we define evil, evil seems to be a situational eye of the beholder kind of question. So if we define evil, maybe I can get a better idea of and that could be a whole show could defining evil. But when we say evil, what do we mean? that is a slippery one.
But I think there is some way in which your existence, your presence in the world leads to pain and suffering and destruction for many others in the rest of the world. So you you steal the resources and you use them to create more suffering than there was before in the world. So I suppose it is somehow deeply connected to this other slippery word which is suffering as you create suffering in the world, you bring suffering to the world.
But here is the problem, I think with it, because I fully see where you are going with that and I understand it. The problem is, is the question of the reason for inflicting suffering. So sometimes one might inflict suffering upon one group of individuals in order to maximize a lack of suffering with another group of individuals or one who might not be considered evil at all, might make the rational, seemingly rational choice of inflicting pain and suffering on a smaller group of people in order to maximize the opposite of that for a larger group of people.
Yeah, that is one of the dark things about a spoken and read the work of Stephen Kotkin. I am not sure if you are familiar with the historian and he is basically a Stalin Joseph Stalin scholar. And one of the things I realized. I am not sure where to put Hitler, but with Stalin. It really seems that he was sane and he thought he was doing good for the world. I really believe from everything I have read about Stalin that he believed that communism is good for the world.
And if you have to kill a few people along the way, it is like you said, the small groups, if you have to sort of remove the people that stand in the way of this utopian system of communism, then that is actually good for the world. And it did not seem to me that he could even consider the possibility that he was evil. He really thought he was doing good for the world. And that is stuck with me because he is one of the most is to our definition of evil.
He seems to have brought more evil onto this world. Than almost any human in history. And I do not know what to do with that. Well, I am fascinated with the concept, so fascinated by it that the very first hardcore history show we ever did, which was a full 15 or 16 minutes, was called Alexander versus Hitler. And the entire question about it was the motivations. Right. So if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody, one of the things they are going to consider is why did you kill them?
Right. And if you killed somebody, for example, in self-defense, you are going to be treated differently than if you malicious, kill, kill somebody maliciously to take their wallet. Right.
And in the show, we we wondered because, you know, I do not really make pronouncements, but we wondered about if you believe Hitler's writings, for example, Mein Kampf, which, you know, is written by a guy who is a political figure who wants to get something that is about as believable as any other political tract would be. But in his mind, the things that he said that he had to do were designed to for the betterment of the German people.
Right. Whereas Alexander the Great, once again, this is somebody from more than two thousand years ago. So with lots of propaganda in the intervening years. But one of the the views of Alexander the Great is that the reason he did what he did was to, for lack of a better word, write his name in a more permanent graffiti on the pages of history. Right. In other words, to glorify himself. And if that is the case, does that make Alexander a worse person than Hitler because Hitler thought he was doing good?
Whereas Alexander, if you believe the interpretation was simply trying to exalt Alexander. So the motivations of the people doing these things, it seems to me matter. I do not think you can just sit there and go. The only thing that matters is the end result, because that might have been an unintentional byproduct, in which case that person, had you been able to show them the future, might have changed what they were doing. So were they evil or misguided or wrong or made the you know, so and I hate to do that because there are certain people like Hitler that I do not feel deserve the benefit of the doubt.
At the same time, if you are fascinated by the concept of evil and you delve into it deeply enough, you are going to want to understand why these evil people did what they did. And sometimes it can confuse the hell out of you. You know, who wants to sit there and try to see things from Hitler's point of view to get a better understanding and and sort of commiserate with. So but obviously, first history show, I am fascinated with the concept.
So do you think it is possible if we put ourselves in the mindset of some of the people that have created so much suffering in the world that all of them had their motivations were had good intentions underlying them? No, I do not.
Simply because there is so many I mean, the law of averages would would suggest that that is not true.
I guess as pure evil possible meaning, you know, again, it is slippery, but you the suffering is the goal. The suffering. Intentional suffering. Yeah. Yes. I think that and I think that there is historical figures that that that one could point to. And but that gets to the deeper question of are these people sane?
Do they have something wrong with them? Are they twisted from something in their youth? You know, these are the kinds of things where where you start to delve into the psychological makeup of these people, in other words, is anybody born evil? And I actually believe that some people are. I think the DNA can get scrambled up in ways. I think the question of evil is important, too, because I think it is an eye of the beholder thing.
I mean, if Hitler, for example, had been successful and we were today on the sixth or seventh leader of the Third Reich since, I think his entire history would be viewed through a different lens because that is the way we do things right. Genghis Khan looks different to the Mongolians than he does to the residents of Baghdad. Right. And I think so. So an eye of the beholder question, I think, comes into all these sorts of things.
As you said, it is a very slippery question.
Where do you put as somebody who is fascinated by military history, where do you put violence as far as in terms of the human condition as a core to being human? Or is it just a little tool that we use every once in a while?
So I am going to respond to your question with a question. What do you see the difference being between violence and force? Let me let me go farther. I am not sure that violence is something that we have to put up with as human beings forever, that we must resign ourselves to violence forever. But I have a much harder time seeing us able to abolish force. And I there is going to be some ground where if those two things are not the same, and I do not know that maybe they are where there is certainly some crossover and the I think force you are an engineer.
you will understand this better than I. But think about it as a physical law. If you can not stop something from moving in a certain direction without pushing back in that same direction, I am not I am not sure that you can have a society or a civilization without the ability to use a counterforce when things are going wrong, whether it is on an individual level. Right. Person attacks another person. So you step in to save that person or on, you know, even at the highest levels of politics or anything else, a counter force to stop the inertia or the impetus of a of another movement.
So I think that force is is a simple, almost law of physics in human interaction, especially at the civilization level. I think civilization requires a certain amount of if not violence than force.
So and again, they are taught I mean, it goes back into St. Augustine, all kinds of Christian beliefs about the the proper use of force. And people have philosophically tried to decide between can you have sort of an ahimsa Buddhist sort of, you know, be nonviolent toward everything and exert no force or or there is a reason to have force in order to create the space for good? I think force is inevitable. Now we can talk. And I have not come up to the conclusion myself.
If there is a distinction to be made between force and violence, I mean, this is is a non-violent force enough or is violence when done for the because of good a different thing than violence done either for the because of evil, as you would say, or simply for random reasons? I mean, we humans lack control. Sometimes we can be violent for no apparent reason or goal. And that is mean you look at the criminal justice system alone in the way we we interact with people who are acting out in ways that we as a society have decided this is intolerable.
Can you deal with that without force and at some level violence? I do not know. Can you maintain peacefulness without force? I do not know. Just to be a little bit more specific about the idea of force, do you put force as general enough to include force in the space of ideas? So you mentioned Buddhism or religion or just Twitter, you know, things farther apart than that is the battles we do in the space of ideas of, you know, the great debates throughout history.
Do you put force into that or do you in this conversation, are we trying to right now keep it to just physical force?
In saying that you you have an intuition that force might be with us much longer than violence. I think the two bleed together, so take. Because it is always it is always my go to example, I am afraid, and I am sure the listeners all hate it, but but take take Germany during the 1920s, early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power, and they were always involved in some level of force, you know, beating up in the streets or whatever it might be.
But think about it more like an intellectual discussion until a certain point. Is there it would be difficult, I imagine, to keep the intellectual counterforce of ideas from at some point degenerating into something that is more coercion counterforce if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about.
So I think the two are intimately connected. I mean, actions follow thought. Right, and a certain point. I think especially when when one is not achieving the goals that they want to achieve through peaceful discussion or argumentation or trying to convince the other side that sometimes the next level of operations is something a little bit more physically imposing, if that makes sense. We go from the intellectual to the physical.
Yeah. So too easily spills over into violence. Yes. And one leads to the other often.
So you kind of implied perhaps a hopeful message. Let me ask you in the form of a question, do you think we will always have war?
I think it goes to the forced question, too, so, for example, what do you do? I mean, we are let us let us play with nation states now, although I do not know that nation states are something we should think of as a permanent constitution, but how is one nation state supposed to prevent another nation state from acting in ways that it would see as either detrimental to the global community or detrimental to the interest of their own nation state? You know, and I think I think we have had this question of going back to ancient times, but certainly in the 20th century, this has come up quite a bit.
I mean, the whole Second World War argument sometimes revolves around the idea of what the proper counterforce should be. Can you create an entity, a League of Nations, a United Nations, a one world entity, maybe even that, that alleviates the need for counterforce involving mass violence and armies and navies and those things? I think that is an open discussion we are still having. it is good to think through that, because having a system like a United Nations, there is usually a centralized control.
So there is humans at the top, there is committees and usually, like leaders emerge as singular figures that then can become corrupted by power. And it is just really important. It feels like a really important thought experiment and something to really rigorously think through. How can you construct systems of government? That are stable enough to push us towards less and less war. And less and less.
And stable and another tough way, which is unfair of application of force, you know, that is really at the core of the question that we are trying to figure out as humans, as our weapons get better and better and better destroying ourselves, it feels like it is important to think about how we minimize the overapplication or unfair application of force. there is other elements that come into play to you and I are discussing this at the very high intellectual level of things, but there is also a tail wagging the dog element to this.
So think of a society of warriors, a tribal society from a long time ago. How much do the fact that you have warriors in your society and that their reason for existing what they take pride in, what they train for, what their status in their own civilization, how much does that itself drive the responses of that society? Right. How much do you need war to legitimize warriors? You know, that is the old argument that you get to.
And we have had this in the 20th century to that that the creation of arms and armies creates an incentive to use them. Right. And and that they themselves can drive that incentive as as a justification for their reasons, for existence. You know, that is where we start to talk about the interactivity of all these different elements of society upon one another. So when we talk about governments and war, we need to take into account the various things those governments have put into place in terms of systems and armies and things like that to to protect themselves.
Right. For reasons we can all understand. But they exert a force on your range of choices, do not they?
it is true. you are making me realize that in my upbringing and I think upbringing of many warriors or heroes, you know, to me, I do not know where that feeling comes from, but to sort of die fighting is is an honorable way to die. It feels like that.
I have always had a problem with this because as a person interested in military history, the distinction is important. And I try to make it at different levels. So at base level, the people who are out there on the front lines doing the fighting, to me, those people can be compared with police officers and firemen and people, fire persons. But I mean people that are involved in an ethical attempt to perform a task which ultimately one can see in many situations as being.
A saving sort of task, right, or or if nothing else, a self-sacrifice for what they see as the greater good. Now, I draw a distinction between the individuals and the entity that they are a part of a military. And I certainly draw a distinction between the military and then the entire, for lack of a better word, military industrial complex that that service is a part of. I feel a lot less moral attachment to to those upper echelons than I do.
The people on the ground, the people on the ground could be any of us and have been in a lot of you know, we have a very professional sort of military now. it is a very a subset of the population. But in other periods of time, we have had conscription and draft and it has not been a subset of the population. it is been the population. Right. And so it is the society oftentimes going to war. And I make a distinction between those warriors and the entities either in the system that they are part of the military or the people that control the military at the highest political levels.
I feel a lot less moral attachment to them, and I have a much harsher about how I feel about them. I do not consider the military itself to be heroic and I do not consider the military industrial complex to be heroic. I do think that is a tail wagging the dog situation. I do think that draws us into looking at military endeavors as a solution to the problem much more quickly than we otherwise might. And to be honest, to tie it all together, I actually look at the victims of this as the soldiers we were talking about.
If you if you set a fire to send firemen into to fight, then I feel bad for the firemen. I feel like you have abused the trust that you give those people. Right. So when when people talk about war, I always think that the people that we have to make sure that a war is really necessary in order to protect are the people that you are going to send over there to fight that the greatest victims in our society of war are often the warriors.
So in my mind, you know, when we see these people coming home from places like Iraq, a place where I would have made the argument and did at the time that we did not belong to me, those people are victims. And I know they do not like to think about themselves that way because it runs totally counter to the to the ethos. But if you are sending people to protect this country shores, those are heroes. If you are sending people to go do something that they otherwise probably do not need to do, but they are there for political reasons or anything else you want to put in that is not defense related.
Well, then you have made victims of our heroes. And so I feel like we do a lot of talk about our troops and our soldiers and stuff, but we do not treat them as valuable as we as the rhetoric makes them sound.
Otherwise, we would be more we would be much more careful about where we put them. If you are going to send my son and I do not have a son, I have daughters, but you are going to send my son into harm's way, I am going to demand that you really need to be sending him into harm's way. And I am going to be angry at you if you put him into harm's way. If he does not, if it does not warrant it. And so I have much more suspicion about the system that sends these people into these situations where they are required to be heroic.
Then I do the people on the ground that I look at as either the people that are defending us, you know, in situations like the Second World War, for example, or the people that turn out to be the individual victims of a system where they are just a cog in a machine and the machine does not really care as much about them as as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate.
And as my own family history, it would be nice if we can talk about there is a gray area in the places that you are talking about. it is a gray area in everything and everything. But when that gray area is part of your own blood, as it is for me, it is. it is worth shining a light on. Sure, give me example what you mean. So you did a program of four episodes of Ghosts of the Front? Yeah. So I was born in the Soviet Union.
I was raised in Moscow. My dad was born and raised in Kiev. My grandmother, who just recently passed away, was raised in Ukraine. She said it is a small city on the border between Russia and Ukraine. I have a grandfather born in Kiev, in Kiev. The interesting thing about the timing of everything, as you might be able to connect, is she survived. she is the most badass woman I have ever encountered in my life. And most of the warrior spirit I carry is probably from her.
She survived Palmer, the Ukrainian starvation of the 30s. She was a beautiful teenage girl during the Nazi occupation of. So she survived all of that.
And, of course, family that everybody, you know, and so many people died the whole process. And one of the things you talk about in your program is that the grey area is even with the Warriors, it happened to them. Just because you are saying now it they did not have a choice. So my my grandfather on the other side, he was a machine gunner.
That was in Ukraine, that that in the Red Army, in the Red Army, and they threw. Like the the statement was that there is a I do not know if it is obvious or not, but the rule was there is no surrender so that you you better die. So you I mean, you are basically the goal was when he was fighting and he was lucky enough.
One of the only to survive by being wounded early on is there was a march of Nazis towards, I guess, Moscow.
And the whole goal in Ukraine was to slow to slow them into the into the winter. I mean, I view him as such a hero and he believed that he is indestructible, which is survivor bias, and that, you know, bullets can not hurt him. And that is what everybody believed. And, of course, basically everyone that he quickly rose through the ranks.
let us just put it this way, because everybody died. it is it was just bodies dragging this heavy machine guns like always, you know, always slowly retreating, shooting and retreating, shooting and retreating and. I do not know, he was a hero to me. I always I grew up thinking that he was the one that sort of defeated the Nazis. Right.
And but the reality that there could be another perspective, which is all of this happened to him by the incompetence of Stalin, the incompetent incompetence and. Men of the Soviet Union being used like pawns in a in a shady league, played a game of chess, right.
So like one narrative is of him as a victim, as you kind of describing, and then somehow that is more paralyzing and that is more I do not know, it feels better to think of him as a hero and as Russia, Soviet Union saving the world.
I mean, that narrative also in the United States that the United States was key in saving the world from the Nazis. It feels like that narrative is powerful for people. I am not sure. And I carry it still with me. But when I think about the right way to think about that war, I am not sure if that is the correct narrative. Let me suggest something. there is a line that that a marine named Eugene Sledge had said once, and I keep it on my phone because it is it is it makes a real distinction.
And he said the front line is really where the war is. And anybody even 100 yards behind the front line does not know what it is really like. Now, the difference is, is there are lots of people miles behind the front line that are in danger. Right. You can be in a medical unit in the rear and artillery could strike you planes because, I mean, you could be in danger. But at the front line, there are two different things.
One is that that at least and I am doing a lot of reading on this right now and reading a lot of veterans accounts. I am James Jones, who wrote books like From Here to Eternity Fictional Accounts of the Second World War, but he based them on his own service. He was at Guadalcanal, for example, in 1942. And Jones had said that the evolution of a soldier in front line action requires an almost surrendering to the idea that you are going to live, that you become accustomed to the idea that you are going to die.
And he said you are a different person simply for considering that thought seriously, because most of us do not. But what that allows you to do is to do that job at the front line. Right? If you are too concerned about your own life, you become less of a good guy at your job. Right. The other thing that the people in the one in the 100 yards of the front line do, that the people in the rear medical unit really do not.
If you kill and you kill a lot. Right. You do not just oh, there is a sniper back here. So I shot him. it is we go from one position to another and we kill lots of people. Those things will change you. And what that tends to do, not universally, because I have read accounts from Red Army soldiers and they are very patriotic. Right. But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later as part of the nostalgia and the remembering.
When you are down at that front 100 yards, it is often boiled down to a very small world. So your grandfather was your grandfather, grandfather at the machine gun. he is concerned about his position and his comrades and the people who he owes a responsibility to. And those it is a very small world at that point. And to me, that is where the heroism is, right. he is not fighting for some giant world civilizational thing. he is fighting to save the people next to him and his own life at the same time because they are saving him, too, and that there is a huge amount of heroism to that.
And that gets to our question about force earlier. Why would you use force? Well, how about to protect these people on either side of me, right? Their lives now is their hatred. I hated the Germans for what they were doing.
As a matter fact, I I got a note from a poll not that long ago, and I have this tendency to refer to the Nazis. Right. The regime that was. And he said, why do you keep calling them Nazis? He says, say, say what? They were they were Germans. And this guy wanted me to not absolve Germany by saying, oh, it was this awful group of people that took over your country. He said the Germans did this.
And there is that bitterness where he says, let us not forget what they did to us and why and what we had to do back. Right. So for me, when we talk about these combat situations, the reason I call these people heroic is because of their fighting to defend things we could all understand. I mean, if you come after my brother and I take a machine gun and shoot you and you are going to overrun me, I mean, you are going to that becomes a situation where we talked about counterforce earlier.
Much easier to call yourself a hero when you are saving people or you are saving this town right behind you. And, you know, if they get through your machine gun, they are going to burn these villages. they are going to throw these people out in the middle of winter. These families. That, to me, is a very different sort of heroism than this amorphous idea of patriotism. You know, patriotism is a thing that we often get used with, right?
People people manipulate us through love of country and all this because they understand that this is something we feel very strongly. But they use it against us sometimes in order to whip up a war fever or to get people. I mean, there is a great line, and I wish I could remember it in its entirety, that Hermann Goering had said about how easy it was to get the people into a war. He says, you know, you just appeal to their patriotism.
I mean, there is buttons that you can push and they take advantage of things like love of country and the way we the way we have a loyalty and admiration to the warriors who put their lives on the line. These are manipulatable things in the human species that reliably can be counted on to move us in directions that in a more sober, reflective state of mind we would consider differently. It gets the I mean, you get this war fever up and people people wave flags and they start denouncing the enemy.
They start saying, you know, we have seen it over and over and over again in ancient times this happened.
But the love of country is also. Beautiful. So I have not seen it in America as much, though people in America love their country like this patriotism strong in America, but it is not as strong as I remember, even with my sort of being younger, the love of the Soviet Union. Now, was it the Soviet Union, this requires a distinction or was it Mother Russia? What it really was, was the Communist Party. OK, so it was this it was a system in place, a system in place, like loving Ivan quite deeply.
Psychoanalyse exactly what you love.
I think you love the that like populist message of the worker of the common man.
So let me let me draw the comparison then. And I often say this, that that the United States, like the Soviet Union, is an ideological based society. Right. So you take a country like France, it does not matter which French government you are in. Now, the French have been the French for a long time, right? it is not based on an ideology.
Right. Whereas what unites the United States is an ideology, freedom, liberty, the Constitution. This is what draws you to the e pluribus unum. Kind of the idea, right?
This that out of many one. Well, what what binds all these unique, different people, the shared beliefs, this ideology. The Soviet Union was the same way because as you know, the Soviet Union, Russia was merely one part of the Soviet Union. And if you believe the rhetoric until Stalin's time, everybody was going to be united under this ideological banner someday. Right. This was a global revolution. So ideological societies are different. And to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal, I mean, I am a liberty person, right?
I would like to see everybody in the world have my system of government, which is part of a of a bias. Right. Because they might not want that. But I think it is better for everyone because I think it is better for me at the same time, when the ideology if you consider and you know the stems from ideas of the Enlightenment and there is a bias there. So my bias are toward the. But you feel and this is why you say we are going to bring freedom to Iraq, we are going to bring freedom to here, we are going to bring freedom because we think we are spreading to use something that is just undeniably positive.
we are going to free you and give you this. it is hard for me to to wipe my own bias away from there. Right. Because if I were in Iraq, for example, I would want freedom. Right. But if you then leave and let the Iraqis vote for whomever they want, are they going to vote for somebody that will I mean, you know, you look at Russia now and I hear from Russians quite a bit because so much of my my views on Russia and the Soviet Union were formed in my formative years.
And and, you know, we were not hearing from many people in the Soviet Union back then. But now you do you hear from Russians today who will say your views on Stalin are archaic and cold. You know, so so you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit. But it goes to this idea of if you gave the people in Russia a free and fair vote, will they vote for somebody who promises them a free and open society based on enlightenment, democratic principles?
Or will they vote for somebody? We in the US would go, what are they doing? they are voting for some strong man who is just good, you know? So I think it is very hard to throw away our own biases and preconceptions and and, you know, it is an all eye of the beholder kind of thing. But when you are talking about ideological societies, it is very difficult to throw off all the years of indoctrination into the superiority of your system.
I mean, listen, in the Soviet Union, Marxism, one way or another was part of every classroom. You know, you could be studying geometry and they will throw Marxism in there somehow because that is what united the society and that is what gave it a higher purpose. And that is what made it in the minds of the people who were its defenders, a superior, morally superior system. And we do the same thing here. In fact, most people do.
But see, you are still French no matter what the what the ideology or the government might be. So so in that sense, it is funny that there would be a Cold War with these two systems, because they are both ideologically based systems involving peoples of many different backgrounds who are united under the umbrella of the ideology.
First of all, that is brilliantly put. I am in a funny position that in my formative years when I was 13.
Is when I you know, teen age is your first love or whatever is I fall and I fell in love with the American set of ideas of freedom and individual selling, are not they? Yes. Yes. But I also remember it is like you remember like maybe an ex-girlfriend or something like that.
I also remember loving as a very different human the the Soviet idea, like we had the national anthem, which is still, I think, the most badass national anthem, which is the Soviet Union, like saying we are the indestructible nation. I mean, just the words are so like American words like, oh, we are nice, like we were freedom, but like a Russian Soviet Union national anthem was like, we are bad motherfuckers. Nobody will destroy us.
I just remember feeling pride in a nation as a kid like dumb, not knowing anything because we all had to recite the stuff. It was. there is a uniformity to everything. there is pride underlying everything. I did not think about all the destructive nature of the bureaucracy, the incompetence, the love, you know, all the things that come with the implementation of communism, especially around the eighties and nineties. But I remember what it is like to love that sort of idea.
So I am in a funny place of like remember, like switching the love because I am you know, I kind of joke around about being Russian. But, you know, my my long term monogamous relationship is now with the idea, the American ideal. Like, I am stuck with it in my mind. But I remember what it was like to love it. And I think about that, too. When people criticize China or they criticize the current state of affairs with how Stalin is remembered and how Putin is to know that the you can not always wear the American ideal of individualism, radical individualism and freedom in analyzing the ways of the world elsewhere, like in China, in Russia, that it does.
If you do not take yourself too seriously as Americans, I will do as I do, it is it is kind of a beautiful love to have for your government to believe in the nation, to let go of yourself and your rights and your freedoms, to believe in something bigger than yourself. that is actually that is a kind of freedom. that is you are actually liberating yourself.
If you think, like life is suffering, you are you are giving into the flow of the water, the flow, the way of the world by giving away more power from yourself and giving it to what you would conceive as as the power of the people together together will do great things.
And really believing in the ideals of what in that in this case, I do not even know what you would call Russia, but whatever the heck that is, authoritarian, powerful state, powerful leader believing that can be.
As beautiful as believing the American ideal, not just that, let me add to what you are saying, and I am very I spend a lot of time trying to get out of my own biases. It is it is a fruitless endeavor long term. But you try to be better than than you normally are. One of the critiques that China and I always, you know, as an American, I tend to think about this as their government. Right. This is a rationale that their government puts forward.
But what you just said, you know, is actually if you can make that viewpoint beautiful is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it. The Chinese would say that what we call human rights in the United States and what we consider to be everybody's birthright around the world is instead Western rights. that is the words they use Western rights. it is a fundamentally Western oriented. And I will go back to the Enlightenment, enlightenment based ideas on what constitutes the rights of man.
And they would suggest that that is not internationally and always applicable. Right, that you can make a case. And again, I do not believe this if this runs against my own personal views, but that you could make a case that the collective well-being of a very large group of people outweighs the individual needs of any single person, especially if those things are in conflict with each other. Right. If you cannot provide for the greater good because everyone's so individualistic will, then really what is the better thing to do?
Right. To suppress individualism so everybody is better off? I think trying to recognize how someone else might see that is important if we want to. You know, you talked about eliminating war. We talk about eliminating conflict. The first need to do that is to try to understand how someone else might view something differently than yourself. I am famously one of those people who buys in to the ideas of traditional Americanism. Right.
And what a lot of people who live today, I mean, they would seem to think that things like patriotism requires a belief in the strong military and all these things we have today. But that is a corruption of traditional Americanism, which viewed all those things with suspicion in the first hundred years of the republic because they saw it as an enemy to the very things that Americans celebrated. Right. How could you have freedom and liberty and individualistic expression if you had an overriding military that was always fighting wars?
And the founders of this country looked to other examples like Europe, for example, and saw that standing militaries, for example, standing armies, were the enemy of liberty? Well, we have a standing army now and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society. If you could if you could go back in time and talk to John Quincy Adams, right. Early president of the United States and show him what we have now, he would think it was awful and horrible.
Somewhere along the line, the Americans had lost their way and forgotten what they were all about. But we have so successfully interwoven this modern military industrial complex with the traditional benefits of the American system and ideology so that they have become intertwined in our thinking. Whereas one hundred and fifty years ago, they were actually considered to be at opposite polarities and a threat to one another. So when you talk about the love of the nation, I tend to be suspicious of those things.
I tend to be suspicious of government. I tend to tend to try very hard to not be manipulated. And I feel like a large part of what they do is manipulation and propaganda. And so I think a healthy skepticism of the nation state is actually one hundred percent Americanism in the traditional sense of the word. But I also have to recognize, as you so eloquently stated, Americanism is not necessarily universal at all. And so I think we have to try to be more understanding.
The traditional American viewpoint is that if a place like China does not allow their people individual human rights, then they are being denied something they are being denied. And one hundred years ago, they would have said their God given rights man is born free. And if he is not free, it is because of something done to him. Right. The government has taken away his God given rights.
I am getting excited just listening to what I mean. But I mean, I think I think the idea that this is universal is in and of itself a bias. Now, do I want freedom for everybody else? I sure do. But the people in the Soviet Union who who really bought into that wanted the workers of the world to unite and not be exploited by, you know, the the greedy, bloodsucking people who worked them to death and pocketed all of the fruits of their labor.
If you frame it that way, that sounds like justice as well. You know, so it is an eye of the beholder sort of thing. I would love to talk to you about Vladimir Putin, sort of while we are on this feeling and wave of empathy and trying to understand others that are not like us. One of the reasons I started this podcast is because I believe that there is a few people I could talk to. Some of it is ego. Some of it is stupidity.
Is this some people I could talk to that not many others can talk to? The one person I was always thinking about was Vladimir Putin. Do you still speak the language? I speak the language very well. That makes it even easy. I mean, you might be you might be appointed for that job.
that is the context in which I am asking you this question. What are your.
Thoughts about Vladimir Putin from historical context, have you studied him or have you thought about him?
Yes, studied is a is a loaded word.
here is here is and again I find it hard sometimes to not filter things through an American lens. So as an American, I would say that the Russians should be allowed to have any leader that they want to have. But what an American would say is. But there should be elections. Right? So if the Russians choose Vladimir Putin and they keep choosing him, that is their business. Where we are as an American, I would have a problem is when that leader stops letting the Russians make that decision.
And we would say, well, now you are no longer ruling by the consent of the governed. you have become the equivalent of a person who may be oppressing your people. You might as well be a dictator. Right now, there is a difference between a freely elected and re-elected and re-elected and re-elected dictator. Right, if that is what they want. And look, I it would be silly to broadbrush the Russians like it would be silly to broadbrush anyone, millions and millions of people with different opinions amongst them all.
But they seem to like a strong person at the helm. And listen, there is a giant chunk of Americans who do, too, in their own country. But an American would say as long as the freedom of choice is is given to the Russians to decide this and not taken away from the rights, it is one thing to say he was freely elected. But a long time ago and we have done away with elections since then is is a different story, too.
So my attitude on Vladimir Putin is if that is who the Russian people want and you give them the choice, right. If he is only there because they keep electing him, that is a very different story. When he stops offering them the option of choosing him or not choosing him, that is when it begins to look nefarious to someone born and raised with the mindset and the ideology that is an integral part of of yours truly. And that I can not you know, you can see gray areas and nuance all you like, but it is hard to escape as you wish.
And you alluded to this, too. it is hard to escape what was indoctrinated into your bones in your formative years.
it is like, you know, your bones are growing right and you can not go back.
So to me, this is so much a part of who I am that I have a hard time jettisoning that and saying, oh, no, Vladimir Putin not being elected anymore is just fine. I am too much of a product of my upbringing to go there. Does that make sense?
Yeah, absolutely.
But of course, those who were saying there is grey areas, which is I believe, as I think through this, but I think there is a point at which Adolf Hitler became the popular choice in Nazi Germany in the thirties.
There is a. In the same way, from an American perspective, you can start to criticize some. In a shallow way, some in a deep way, the way that Putin has maintained power is by controlling the press, so limiting one other freedom that we Americans value, which is the freedom of the press or freedom of speech, that he it is very possible. Now, things are changing now, but for most of his presidency, he was the popular choice.
And sometimes by far and, you know, I have I actually do not have real family in Russia who do not love Putin. The only people who write to me about Putin and not liking him are like sort of activists who are young. Right. But would like to me, they are strangers. I do not know anything about them. The people I do know have a big family in Russia. They love Putin. They do. They miss elections. Would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box and or are they so in love with him that they are they would not want to take a chance that someone might vote him out?
No, they do not think of it this way. And they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy and corruption that is lurking in the shadows, which is true in Russia, right everywhere, everywhere.
But like there is something about the Russian, it is the remnants. it is corruption is so deeply part of the Russians. So the Soviet system that even the overthrow of the Soviet, the the the breaking apart of the Soviet Union and Putin coming and reforming a lot of the system, it is still deeply in there. And and they are aware of that.
that is part of the like the love for Putin is partially grounded in the fear of what happens when the corrupt take over, the greedy take over.
And they see Putin as the stabilizer as like a hard like force that says a counterforce counterforce to get your shit together. Like basically from the Western perspective, Putin is terrible. But a firm from the Russian perspective, Putin is the only thing holding this thing together before it goes if it collapses. Now, the from the Garry Kasparov has been loud on this. You know, a lot of people from the Western perspective say, well, if it has to collapse, let it collapse.
You know, that is easier said than done when you do not have to live through that. Exactly. And so anyone worrying about their family, about and they also remember the, um, the inflation and the economic instability and the suffering and the starvation that happened in the nineties with the collapse of the Soviet Union. And they saw the kind of reform and the economic vibrancy that happened when Putin took power that they think like this guy is holding it together and they see elections as potentially being mechanisms by which the corrupt people can manipulate the system unfairly, as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice.
They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections, to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries. And so I think one of the beliefs that is important to the American system is the belief in the electoral system that the voice of the people can be heard in the various systems of government, whether it is judicial, whether it is of I mean, basically the assumption is that the system works well enough for you to be able to elect the popular choice.
OK, so there is a couple of things that come to mind on that. The first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs. there is a belief in political science. You know, it is not the the overall believe it, but that every society is sort of an oligarchy, really, if you break it down. Right. So what you are talking about are some of the people who would form an oligarchic class in in in Russia and that Putin is the guy who can harness the power of the state to keep those people in check.
The problem, of course, in a system like that, a strongman system right. Where you have somebody who can who can hold the reins and steer the ship when the ship is violently in a storm is the succession. So if you are not creating a system that can operate without you, then that terrible instability and that terrible future that you that you justify the strongman for is just awaiting your future, right? I mean, unless unless he is actively building the system that will outlive him and allow successors to do what he is doing, then then what you have done here is create a temporary, I would think, a temporary stability here, because it is the same problem you have in a monarchy, right.
Where where you have this one king and he is particularly good or you think he is particularly good, but he is going to turn that job over to somebody else down the road. And the system does not guarantee because. No one's really worked on. And again, you would tell me if Putin is putting into place, I know he is talked about it over the years, putting into place a system that can outlive him and that will create the stability that the people in Russia like him for when he is gone.
Because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards, then one might argue, well, we had 20 good years, you know, of stability. But I mean, I would say that if we are talking about a ship of state here, the guy steering the ship, maybe if you want to look at it from the Russian point of view, has done a great job, maybe just saying, but the rocks are still out there and he is not going to be at the helm forever.
So one would think that his job is to make sure that there is going to be someone who can continue to steer the ship for the people of Russia after he is gone. Now, let me ask because I am curious and ignorant. So is he doing that, do you think? Is he setting it up so that when there is no Putin, the state is safe? From the beginning? That was the idea. Whether one of the fascinating things I read every biography, English written biography on Putin.
So I have not I need to think more deeply. But one of the fascinating things is how the power change Vladimir Putin, he was a different man when he took power than he is today. I actually in many ways admire the man that took power, I think is is very different than Stalin and Hitler at the moment. They took power. I think Hitler and Stalin were both in our previous discussion already on the trajectory of evil. I think Putin was a humble, loyal, honest man when he took power.
The man he is today is worth thinking about and studying.
I am not sure that that that is an old line, though, about absolute power corrupts absolutely.
But it is you know, it is kind of a line. You know, it is a beautiful quote, but you have to really think about it, you know, like, what does that actually mean? One of the things that I still have to do, you know, I have been focusing on securing the conversation, right. So I have been I have not gone to the dark place yet because I feel like I can not do the dark thing for too long. So I really have to put myself in the mind of Putin.
Leading up to the conversation, but for now, my sense is his he took power when Yeltsin gave him one of the big sort of acts of the new Russia was, for the first time in its history, a leader. Could have continued being in power and chose to give away power, that was the George Washington you in the United States would look at that as an absolute positive, as a sign of good things.
Yes. And so that was a huge act. And Putin said that that that was the defining thing that will define Russia for the 21st century, that act, and he will carry that flag forward. that is why in rhetoric, he after two terms, he gave away power to Medvedev.
And yet. But it was a puppet, right? Yes, but it was.
But like the still the story was being told. I think he believed it early on. I think he I believe he still believes it, but I think he is deeply suspicious of the corruption that lurks in the shadows. And I do believe that like somebody who thinks click bait journalism is broken, journalist annoy the hell out of me.
Journalism is working perfectly. Journalism's broken German journalists make things worse.
So I understand from Putin's perspective that journalism journalists can be seen as the enemy of the state because people think journalists write these deep, beautiful philosophical pieces about criticizing the structure of government and the proper policy steps that we need to take to make a greater nation. No, they they are unfairly take stuff out of context. They they are critical in ways that are shallow and not interesting. They they call you a racist or sexist or they make up stuff all the time.
So I can put myself in the mindset of a person that thinks that it is OK to remove that kind of shallow, fake news voice from the system. The problem is, of course, that is a slippery slope to then you remove all the annoying people from the system and then you change what anois means, which annoying starts becoming a thing that like anyone who opposes the system, I mean, I get I get the slippery.
it is obvious that it becomes a slippery slope. But I can also put myself in the mindset of the people that says it is OK to remove the liars from the system as long as it is good for Russia.
And OK, so herein lies and this again, the traditional American perspective, because we have had yellow so-called yellow journalism since the founding of the Republic. that is nothing new.
But but the problem then comes into play when you remove journalists even, you know, it is a broad brush thing because you remove both the crappy ones who are lying and the ones who are telling the truth to you are left with simply the approved government. Journalists write the ones who are toeing the government's line, in which case the truth, as you see it, is a different kind of fake news, right? it is the fake news from the government instead of the click bait news and.
Oh, yeah, maybe truth mixed in to all that, too, in some of the outlets. The problem I always have with our system here in the United States right now is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods. And look, I have got 30 years in journalism. My job used to be to go through before the Internet, all the newspapers and and find that I used to know all the journalists by name and I could pick out know who they were.
And and and and I have a hard time picking out the truth from the falsehood. So I think constantly. How are people who do not have all this background, who have lives or who are trained in other specialties, how do they do it? But if the government is the only approved outlet for truth, a traditional American and a lot of other traditional societies based on these ideas of the Enlightenment that I talked about earlier would see that as a disaster waiting to happen or a tyranny in progress.
Does that make sense?
It totally makes sense. And I would agree with you. I still agree with you. But it is clear that something about the freedom of the press and freedom of speech in today, like literally the last few years with the Internet, is changing. And the argument, you know, you could say that the American system of freedom of speech is as broken because the here is here is the belief I grew up on and I still hold, but I am starting to be sort of trying to see multiple views on it.
My belief was that freedom of speech results in a stable trajectory towards truth always. So like truth will emerge as my sort of faith and belief that that, yeah, there is going to be lies all over the place. But there would be like a stable thing. That is true. that is carried forward. To the public now, it feels like it is possible to go towards a world where nothing is true or true. This is something that groups of people convince themselves of.
And there is multiple groups of people. And the idea of some universal truth, I suppose, is the better thing is, is something that we can no longer exist under. Some people believe that the Green Bay Packers is the best football team and some people can think the Patriots and they deeply believe it to where they call the other groups liars.
Now, that is fun for sports. that is fun for favorite flavors of ice cream. But they might believe that about science, about various aspects of politics, various aspects of sort of different policies within the function of our government.
And that is not just like some weird thing we complain about, but they will be the nature of things like truth is something we can no longer have.
Well, let us and let me romanticize the American history of this, too, because the American press was often just as biased, just as I mean, I always look to the 1970s as the high watermark of the American journalistic know the post Watergate era, where it was actively going after the abuses of the government and all these things. But there was a famous speech, very quiet, though, very quiet, given by Katharine Graham, who was a Washington Post editor, I believe.
And I actually somebody sent it to me. We had to get it off of a journalism like a J-Star kind of thing. And she at a at a luncheon assured that the to the government people at the luncheon, do not worry, this is not going to be something that we make a trend. we are not because the position of the government is still something that was carried, that the newspapers were the water and the newspapers were the big thing up until certainly the late 60s or at least the newspapers were still the water carrier of the government.
Right. And they were the water carriers of the owners of the newspaper. So let us not pretend there was some angelic, wonderful time. And I am saying to me, because I was the one who brought it up, let us not pretend there was any super age of truthful journalism and all that. And I mean, you go to the revolutionary period in American history and it looks every bit as bad as today. Right. that is a hopeful message, actually.
So things may not be as bad as they look more like a stock market and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness or believability of the press. And there are periods where it was higher than other periods. The funny thing about the so-called click bait era, and I do think it is terrible, but I mean, it resembles earlier eras to me. So I always compare it to when I was a kid growing up, when I thought journalism was as good as it is ever gotten.
It was never perfect. But it is also something that you see very rarely in other governments around the world. And there is a reason that journalists are often killed regularly and a lot of countries. And it is because they report on things that the authorities do not want reported on. And I have always thought that that was what journalism should do, but it is got to be truthful. Otherwise, it is just a different kind of propaganda. Right. Can we talk about Genghis Khan, Genghis Khan?
By the way, is it Genghis Khan again? Yes, it is not Genghis Khan.
it is either Genghis Khan or Chingis Khan.
So let us go with Genghis Khan.
The only thing I will be able to say with any certainty, last certain thing I will say about it, it is like, I do not know, give versus Jeff.
I do not know. I do not know how I do not know how it ever got started the wrong way. Yeah.
So first of all, your episodes on Genghis Khan for many people are the favorite. it is fascinating to think about events that had so much like in their ripple's, had so much impact on so much of human civilization, in your view. Was he an evil man this close to a discussion of evil? Another way to put it is I have read he is much loved and much in many parts of the world like Mongolia, and I have also read arguments that say he was quite a progressive for the time.
So where do you put him as a progressive or as an evil destroyer of humans?
As I often say, I am not a historian, which is why what I try to bring to the hardcore history podcasts are these subthemes. So each show has and they are not. I try to kind of soft-pedal them so they are not always like really right in front of your face. In that episode, the soft pedaling subtheme had to do with what we refer to as a historical arsonist. And it is because some historians have taken the position that some times and and most of this is earlier stuff, historians do not do this very much anymore.
But these were the wonderful questions I grew up with that blend. it is almost the intersection between history and philosophy. And the idea was that sometimes the world has become so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption or just stagnation that somebody has to come in or some group of people or some force has to come in and do the equivalent of a forest fire to clear out all the dead wood so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated and society can then move forward. And there is a lot of these periods where the historians of the past will portray these figures who come in and do horrific things as creating a normal service for mankind.
Right. Creating the foundations for a new world that will be better than the old one. And it is a recurring theme. And so this was the subtheme of the of the Khans podcast, because otherwise you do not need me to tell you the story of the Mongols, but I am going to bring up the historical arsonist element. And but this gets to how the con has been portrayed, right? If you want to say, oh, yes, he cleared out the deadwood and made for a well, then it is a positive thing.
If you say my family was in the forest fire that he said, you are not going to see it that way. Much of what Genghis Khan is credited with on the upside. Right. So things like religious toleration and you will say, well, he was religiously the Mongols were religious, religiously tolerant. And so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer kind of thing. But this needs to be seen within the context of their empire, which was very much like the Roman viewpoint, which is the Romans did not care a lot of time what your local people worshipped.
They wanted stability. And if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes and did not require the Legionaries to come in and and then they did not care. Right. And the cons were the same way. Like, they do not care what you are practising as long as it does not disrupt their empire and because them trouble. But what I always like to point out is, yes, but the con could still come in with his representatives to your town, decide your daughter was a beautiful woman that they wanted in the concubine and they would take them.
So how liberal an empire is this? Right. So, so many of the things that they get credit for is, though there is some kind of nice guys may in another way of looking at it, just be a simple mechanism of control right away to keep the empire stable. they are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. They have decided that this is the best. And I love because the Mongols were what we would call a pagan people.
Now, I love the fact that they I think we call it threat. The term we used had to do with like like they were hedging their bets religiously. Right. They did not know which God was the right one. So as long as you are all praying for the help of the con, we are maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are, they get the message right. So I think it is been portrayed as something like a liberal empire.
And the idea of Mongul university university reality is more about conquering the world. And it is like saying, you know, we are going to bring stability to the world by conquering it. Well, what if that is Hitler, right?
He could make the same case or Hitler was not really the world conqueror like that because he would not have been he would not have been trying to make it equal for all peoples. But my point being that it kind of takes the positive moral slant out of it. If their motivation was not a positive moral slant to the motive and and the Mongols did not see it that way. And I think the way that it is portrayed is like and I was like to use this analogy, but it is like shooting an arrow and painting a bull's eye around it afterwards.
Right. How how do we how do we justify and make them look good in a way that they themselves probably enlist? We do not have the Mongul point of view, per say. I mean, there is something called the secret history, the Mongols, and there is things written down by Mongolian overlords through people like Persian and Chinese scribes later. We do not have their point of view, but it sure does not look like this was an attempt to create some wonderful place where everybody was living a better life than they.
You were before, I think that is that is later people are putting a nice, rosy spin on it.
So but there is an aspect to it. Maybe you can correct me because I am projecting sort of my idea of what it would take to to to conquer so much land is the ideology is emergent. So if I were to guess, the Mongols started out as exceptionally as warriors who valued. Excellence in skill of killing and not even killing, but like the the actual practice of war and you can start out small, you can grow and grow and grow. And then in order to maintain the stability of the things over which of the conquered lands, you developed a set of ideas with which you can, like you said, establish control.
But it was emergent. And it seems like the core first principle idea of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors.
That felt that felt to me like the starting point. It was not some ideology, like with Hitler and Stalin, with Hitler, the terrorist ideology that did not have anything to do with war underneath it. It was more about conquering. It feels like the Mongols started out more organically. I would say it is like this phenomena started emergently and they were just like similar to the Native Americans with the Comanches, the different warrior tribes. The Joe Rogan is currently obsessed with the that what led me to look into it more, they seem to just start out just valuing the skill of fighting whatever the tools of war they had, which were pretty primitive, but just to be the best warriors they could possibly be, make a science out of it.
That is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it in the beginning. I am going to back up a second, I am reminded of the line set about the Romans that they create a wasteland and call it peace, that is now.
But but but there is a lot of conquerors like that, right, where you will sit there and listen historians forever. it is the it is the famous trade offs of empire. And they will say, well, look at the trade that they facilitated and look at, you know, the religion, all those kinds of things. But they come at the cost of all those peoples that they conquered forcibly and and by force integrated into their empire. The one thing we need to remember about the Mongols that makes them different than, say, the Romans.
And this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade. But I am fascinated with it. And it is more like the Comanches that you just brought up is that the Mongols are not a settled society, OK? They are. They are. They come from a nomadic tradition. Now, several generations later, when you have a Kubla Khan as as the as the emperor of China, it is beginning to be a different thing. Right. And the Mongols, when their empire broke up, the ones that were in settled, the so-called settled societies.
Right. Iran, places like that, they will become more like that over time. The rulers of those places were traditionally and the Mongols and say like that, the cognata, the Golden Horde, which is still in in their traditional nomadic territories, will remain traditionally more Mongol. But when you start talking about who the Mongols were, I tried to make a distinction. they are not some really super special people. they are just the latest Confederacy in an area that saw nomadic confederacies going back to the beginning of recorded history.
The citizens, the summations, the Avaaz, the Huns, the Magyars. I mean, these are all the nomadic you know, the nomads of the Eurasian steppe were huge, huge players in the history of the world until gunpowder nullified their their traditional weapons system, which I have been fascinated with because their traditional weapons system is not one you could copy because you were talking about being the greatest warriors you could be. Every warrior society I have ever seen values that what the what the nomads had of the Eurasian steppe was this relationship between human beings and animals that changed the equation.
It was how they rode horses and societies like the Byzantines, which would form one flank of the step. And then all the way on the other side, you had China and below that you had Persia. These societies would all attempt to create mounted horsemen who used archery, and they did a good job, but they were never the equals of the nomads because those people were literally raised in the saddle. They compared them to send Tazz, the Comanches, great example, considered to be the best horse riding warriors in North America.
The Comanches I always love watching. there is paintings. George Catlin, the famous painter who painted the Comanches, illustrated it, but the Mongols and the Scythians and set the ends in a vase. And all these people did it to where they would shoot from underneath the horse's neck, hiding behind the horse the whole way. You look at a picture of somebody doing that and it is insane. This is what the Byzantines could not do and the Chinese could not do. And it was a different level of of harnessing a human animal relationship that gave them a military advantage that could not be copied.
Right. It could be emulated, but they were never as good. Right. that is why they always hired these people. They hired mercenaries from these areas because they were incomparable. Writes the combination of people who were shooting bows and arrows from the time they were toddlers who were writing from the time they were who rode all the time. I mean, they were the ones were Bow-Legged, the Romans said, because they were never they ate, slept everything in the saddle.
That creates something that is difficult to copy and it gave them a military advantage. You know, I enjoy reading actually about when that military advantage ended. So 17th and 18th century when the Chinese on one flank and the Russians on the other are beginning to use firearms and stuff to break this military power of these of these various carns, the Mongols were simply the most dominating and most successful of the confederacies. But if you break it down, they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid of the apex of the food chain.
And a lot of the people that were known as Mongols were really lots of other tribes, non Mongolian tribes, that when the Mongols conquer you after they killed a lot of you, they incorporated you into their confederacy and often made you go first, you know, going to fight somebody. we are going to make these people go out in front and suck up all the arrows before we go in and finish the job.
So to me and I guess a fan of the Mongols would say that the difference and what made the Mongols different was not the weapons system or the fighting or the Warriors or the armor or anything. It was Genghis Khan. And if you go look at the other really dangerous from the outside world's perspective, dangerous step nomadic confederacies from past history was always when some great leader emerged that could unite the tribes. And you see the same thing in Native American history to a degree, too.
You had people like Atila, right? Or there is one called tumin. You go back in history and these people make the history books because they caused an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors that normally I mean, Chinese, Byzantine and Persian approaches to the steppe. People were always the same. They would pick out tribes to be friendly with. They would give them money, gifts, hire them, and they would use them against the other tribes.
And generally Byzantine, especially in Chinese diplomatic history, was all about keeping these tribes separated. do not let them form confederations of large numbers of them because then they are unstoppable. Attila was a perfect example. The Huns were another lord, the Turks, another large confederacy of these people, and they were devastating when they could unite. So the diplomatic policy was, do not let them. that is what made the Mongols different as Genghis Khan united them. And then, unlike most of the tribal confederacies, he was able they were able to hold it together for a few generations to linger on the little thread.
They started pulling on this man, Genghis Khan, that was a leader agent. What do you think makes a great leader? Maybe if you have other examples throughout history? And great again, let us lose that use that term loosely now I am going to ask for a definition, great uniter of whether it is evil or good. It does not matter.
Is there somebody who stands out to Alexander the Grace of good talking about military or ideology?
Some people bring up FDR or or I mean, it could be the founding fathers of this country or we can go to war.
Was the man of the century up there, Hitler of the 20th century and Stalin. And these people had really amassed the amount of power that probably has never been seen in the history of the world. Is there somebody who stands out to you by way of trying to define what makes a great uniter, a great leader in one man or woman maybe in the future?
it is an interesting question and one I have thought a lot about because, well, let us take Alexander the Great as an example, because Alexander fascinated the world of his time, fascinated. Ever since, people have been fascinated with the guy. But Alexander was a hereditary monarch, right? He was handed the kingdom, which is fascinating. Right. But he did not need to rise from nothing to get that job. In fact, he reminds me of a lot of other leaders of Frederick the Great, for example, in Prussia.
These are people who inherited the greatest army of their day. Alexander, unless he was an imbecile, was going to be great no matter what, because, I mean, if you inherit the Vermont, you are going to be able to do something with it, right. Alexander's father may have been greater. Philip, he Philip. The second was the guy who who literally did create a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people that were continually beset by their neighbors.
he is the one that reformed that army, took things that he had learned from other Greek leaders like the theban leader epaminondas, and then laboriously over his lifetime stabilized the frontiers, built this system. He lost an eye doing it. He he he his leg was made lame. I mean, this was a man who looked like he built the empire and led from from the front ranks. I mean, so and then and then who may have been killed by his son?
We do not know who assassinated Philip, but then handed the greatest army the world had ever seen. His son, who then did great things with it. You see this this pattern many times in my mind. I am not sure Alexander really can be that great when you compare him to people who arose from nothing. So the difference between what we would call in the United States, the self-made man or the one who inherits a fortune, there is an old line that, you know, it is a slur, but it is about rich people.
And it is like he was born on he was born on third base and thought he hit a triple. Right. Philip was born at home plate and he had to hit. Alexander started on third base. And so I try to draw a distinction between them. Genghis Khan is tough because there is two traditions. The tradition that we grew up with here in the United States and that I grew up learning was that he was a self-made man. But there is a tradition, and it may be one of those things that is put after the fact, because a long time ago, whether or not you had blue blood in your veins was an important distinction.
And so the distinction that you often hear from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman who had been deprived of his inheritance. So he was a blue blood anyway. I do not know which is true. there is certainly I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan, you have to go. That is a wicked amount of things to have achieved. he is very impressive as a figure. Attila's very impressive as a figure. Hitler's an interesting figure. he is one of those people.
You know, the more you study about Hitler, the more you wonder where the defining moment was. Because if you look at his life, I mean, Hitler was a relatively common soldier in the First World War. I mean, he was brave. He got he got some decorations. In fact, the highest decoration he got in the First World War was given to him by a Jewish officer. And it was all he often did not talk about that decoration, even though it was the more prestigious one, because it would open up a whole can of worms you did not want to get into.
But Hitler's I mean, if you said who was Hitler today, one of the top things you are going to say is he was an anti-Semite. Well, then you have to draw a distinction between general regular anti-Semite Semitism that was pretty common in the era and something that was a rabid level of anti-Semitism. But Hitler did not seem to show a rabid level of anti-Semitism until after or at the very end of the First World War. So if this is a defining part of this person's character and much of what we consider to be his his evil stems from that, what happened to this guy when he is an adult?
Right. he is already fought in the war to change him. So, I mean, it is almost like the old there was always a movie theme. Somebody gets hit by by something on the head and their whole personality changes. Right? I mean, it almost seems something like that. So I do not think I call that necessarily a great leader. To me, the interesting thing about Hitler is what the hell happened to a nondescript person who did not really impress anybody with his skills?
And then in the 1920s is all of a sudden, as you said, sort of the man of the hour. Right. So that to me is kind of but I have this feeling that Genghis Khan and we do not really know was an impressive human being from the get go. And then he was raised in this environment with pressure on all sides. You you start with this diamond and then you polish it and you harden it his whole life. Hitler seems to be a very unimpressive gemstone most of his life.
And then all of a sudden, so, I mean, I do not think I can label great leaders. And I am always fascinated by that idea that and I am I am trying remember who the quote was by that that great man. Oh, Lord Acton. So great men are often not good men and that in order to be great, you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities that we normally would consider a Jesus or a Gandhi or, you know, these these qualities that one looks at as as the good, upstanding moral qualities that we should all aspire to as examples.
Right. The Buddha, whatever it might be, those people would not make good leaders, because what you need to be a good leader often requires the kind of choices that a true philosophical Diogenes moral man would not make. Yeah.
So I do not have an answer to your question. How about that?
that is a very long way of saying, I do not know, just linger a little bit. It does feel like from my study of Hitler that the time molded the man versus Genghis Khan where it feels like he the man molded his time. Yes.
And I feel that way about a lot of those nomadic Confederacy builders that they really seem to be these figures that that stand out as extraordinary for want in one way or another. Remembering, by the way, that almost all the history of them were written by the enemies that they so mistreated that they were probably never going to get any good press.
They did not write themselves. that is a caveat. We should always be basically nomadic or Native American peoples or tribal peoples anywhere generally do not get the advantage of being able to write the history of their heroes. OK, I have I have recently almost done with the rise in the fall of the Third Reich and one of the. Historical descriptions of Hitler's rise to power, Nazis rise to power. there is a few philosophical things I would like to ask you to see if you can help us like.
One of the things I think about is how does one be a hero in 1930s Nazi Germany? What does it mean to be a hero? What do heroic actions look like? I think about that because. I think about how I move about in this world today, you know, that we live in really chaotic and tense times where I do not think you want to draw any parallels between Nazi Germany and modern day in any of the nations can think about.
But it is not out of the realm of possibility that. Authoritarian governments take hold, authoritarian companies take hold, and I would like to think that I could be in my little small way and inspire others to take the heroic action before things get bad. And I kind of try to place myself in what would 1930's Germany look like, is it possible to stop a Hitler? Is it even the right way to think about it and how does one be a hero in it?
I mean, you often talk about that living through a moment in history is very different than looking at that history, looking when you look back. I also think about. It would it be possible to understand what is happening, that the bells of war are are ringing? It seems that most people did not seem to understand, you know, late into the 30s that war is coming. that is fascinating. And the United States side inside Germany, like the opposing figures, the German military did not seem to understand this.
Maybe ask the other countries, certainly France and England did not seem to understand this, that kind of try to put myself into 1930s Germany as I am Jewish, which is another little twist on the whole, like what would I do?
What should one do? Do you have interesting answers? So earlier we had talked about Putin and we had talked about patriotism and love of country and those sorts of things in order to be a hero in Nazi Germany. By our views here, you would have had to have been. Anti patriotic to the average Germans viewpoint in the 1930s, right, you would have to oppose opposed your own government and your own country, and that is a very it would be a very weird thing to go to people in Germany and say, listen, the only way you are going to be seen as as a good German and a hero to the country that will be your enemies is we think you should oppose your own government.
it is it is a strange position to put the people in a government in saying you need to be against your leader. You need to oppose your government's policies. You need to oppose your government. You need to hope and work for its downfall. That does not sound patriotic. It would not sound patriotic here in this country. If you if you made a similar argument, I will go away from the 1930s and go to the 1940s to answer your question.
So there is movements like the White Rose Movement in Germany, which involved young people really and from various backgrounds, religious backgrounds are often who worked openly against the Nazi government at a time when power was already consolidated, the Gestapo was in full force and they execute people who are against the government.
And these young people would go out and distribute pamphlets and they and many of them got their heads cut off with guillotines for their trouble. And they knew that that was going to be the penalty. That is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice and willingness to die and almost not even willingness because they were so open about it. it is almost a certainty, right? that is incredibly moving to me, so when we talk and we talked earlier about sort of the human spirit and all that kind of thing.
There are people in the German military who opposed and worked against Hitler, for example, but to me that is almost cowardly compared to what these young people did in the White Rose movement, because those people in the in the Vermont, for example, who were secretly trying to undermine Hitler, they are not really putting their lives on the line to the same degree. And so I think when I look at heroes and I remember once saying there were no conscientious objectors in in Germany as a way to point out to people that you did not have a choice, you know, you were going to serve in there.
And I got letters from Jehovah's Witnesses who said, yes, there were and we got sent to the concentration camps. Those are remarkably brave things. it is one thing to have your own set of standards and values. it is another thing to say, oh, no, I am going to display them in a way that with this regime, that is a death sentence. And not just for me, for my family, right. In these regimes, there was not a lot of distinction made between father and son and wives.
that is a remarkable sacrifice to make and far beyond what I think I would even be capable of. And so the admiration comes from seeing people who appear to be more morally profound than you are yourself. So when I look at this, I look at that, that kind of thing, and I just say, wow. And the funny thing is, if you have gone to most average Germans on the street in 1942 and said, what do you think of these people?
they are going to think of them as traitors who probably got what they deserved. So that is the eye of the beholder thing. it is the power of the state to to so propagandize values and morality in a way that favors the state that you can turn. People who today we look at is unbelievably brave and moral and crusading for righteousness and turn them into enemies of the people. So, I mean, in my mind, it would be people like that.
See, I. I think so. Hero is a funny word and we romanticize the notion. But if I could drag you back to 1930s Germany from 1940. Sure.
I feel like the heroic actions that does not accomplish much. Is not what I am referring to.
So there is many heroes I look up to that, like David Goggins, for example, the guy who runs crazy distances, he runs for no purpose except for the suffering itself. And I think his willingness to challenge the limits of his mind is is heroic. I guess I am looking for a different term, which is how could Hitler have been stopped? My sense is that he could have been stopped in the battle of ideas world or people, millions of people were suffering economically, were suffering because of the betrayal of World War One in terms of the love of country and how they felt they were being treated.
And a charismatic leader that inspired love and unity that is not destructive could have emerged. And that is where the battle should have been fought. I would suggest that we need to take into account the context of the times that led to Hitler's rise of power and created the conditions where his message resonated, that is not a message that resonates at all times, right. It is impossible to understand the rise of Hitler without dealing with the First World War and the aftermath of the First World War and the inflationary terrible depression in Germany and all these things and the dissatisfaction with the Weimar Republic government, which was often seen as as something put into which it was put into place by the victorious powers.
Hitler referred to the people that signed those agreements, that signed the armistice as the November criminals. And he used that as a phrase which resonated with the population. This was a population that was embittered. And even if they were not embittered, the times were so terrible and the options for operating within the system in a non radical way seemed totally discredited. Right. You can work through the Weimar Republic, but they tried and it was not working anyway. And then the alternative to the Nazis who were bully boys in the street were communist agitators.
That, to the average conservative German, seem no better. So you have three options. If you are an average German person, you can go with the discredited government put in power by your enemies. That was not working any way you could go with the Nazis, who seemed like a bunch of super patriots calling for the restoration of German authority. Or you could go with the communists. And the entire thing seemed like a litany of poor options. Right. And in this realm, Hitler was able to triangulate, if you will.
He came off as a person who was going to restore German greatness at a time when this was a powerful message. But if you do not need German greatness restored, it does not resonate. Right. So the reason that your love idea and all this stuff I do not think would have worked in the time period is because that was not a commodity that the average German was in search of then.
Well, it is interesting to think about whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms, through ideas that are not so from our perspective today. So evil. I do not know what the right term is, but the war continued in a way.
So remember that, that when Germany when Hitler's is rising to power, the French are in control of parts of Germany. Right. The Rhorer, one of the main industrial heartlands of Germany, was occupied by the French. So there is never this point where you are allowed to let the hate dissipate, right? Every time maybe things were calming down, something else would happen to stick the knife in and twisted a little bit more from the average Germans perspective. Right.
The reparations. Right. So if you say, OK, well, we are going to get back on our feet. The reparations were crushing these things, prevented the idea of love or brotherhood and all these things from taking hold. And even if there were Germans who felt that way, and there most certainly were, it is hard to overcome the power of everyone else. You know what I always say when people talk to me about humanity is I believe on individual levels we are capable of everything and anything good, bad or indifferent.
But collectively it is different. Right. And in the time period that that we are talking about here, messages of peace on Earth and love your enemies and and and all these sorts of things were absolutely deluged and overwhelmed and drowned out by the bitterness, the hatred. And let us be honest, the sense that you were continually being abused by your former enemies. There were a lot of people in the allied side that realized this and said, we are setting up the next war.
This is I mean, they understood that you can only do certain things to collective human populations for a certain period of time before it is natural for them to want to. And there are you can see German posters from the region, Nazi propaganda posters that show them breaking off the chains of their enemies. And I mean, Germany awake. Right? That was the the great slogan. So I think. Love is always a difficult option, and in the context of those times, it was even more disempowered than normal.
Well, this goes to the just to linger in that for a little longer. The question of the inevitability of history.
Do you think Hitler could have been stopped? Do you think this kind of force that you are saying that there was a pain in those building, there is a hatred that was building? Do you think there was a way to avert. I mean, there is two questions could have been a lot worse. And could have been better in the trajectory of history in the 30s and 40s, the most logical see we had started this conversation brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion and buttons it up nicely.
We talked about force and counterforce earlier. The most obvious and much discussed way that Hitler could have been stopped has nothing to do with Germans when he remilitarized the Rhineland. Everyone talks about what a couple of French divisions would have done had they simply gone in and contested.
And this was something Hitler was extremely I mean, it might have been the most nervous time in his entire career because he was afraid that they would have responded with force and he was in no position to do anything about it if they did. So this is where you get the people who say, you know, and Churchill is one of these people to where they talk about that, that, you know, he should have been stopped militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak, I do not think.
Listen, there were candidates in the in the in the Catholic center party and others in the Weimar Republic that maybe could have done things, and it is beyond my understanding of specific German history to talk about it intelligently. But I do think that had the French responded militarily to Hitler's initial moves into that area, that he would have been thwarted. And I think he himself believed, if I am remembering my reading, that this would have led to his downfall. So the potential what I do not like about this is that it almost legitimizes military intervention at a very early stage to prevent worse things from happening.
But it might be a pretty clear cut case. But but but it should also be pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy on the part of the allies for the fact that, you know, the Germans probably should have Germany back. And this is traditional German land.
I mean, they were trying in a funny way. it is almost like the love and the sense of justice on the allies part may have actually stayed their hand in a way that would have prevented much, much, much worse things later. But if the times were such that the message of a Hitler resonated, then simply removing Hitler from the equation would not have removed the context of the times. And that means one of two things. Either you could have had another one.
Or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad, in a different direction. I do not know what that means because it is hard to imagine anything could be worse than what actually occurred. But history's funny that way and that Hitler's always everyone's favorite example of the difference between the great man theory of history and the trends and forces theories of history. Right. The Times made a Hitler possible and maybe even desirable to some if you took him out of the equation.
Those trends and forces are still in place. Right. So what does that mean? If you take him out and the door is still open to somebody else, walk through it?
Yeah, that is mathematically speaking, the. The probability of charismatic leaders emerge, I am so torn on that I am at this point, here is another way to look at it.
The institutional stability of Germany in that time period was not enough to push back. And there are other periods in German history. I mean, that Hitler arose in prison in 1913. He does not get anywhere because Germany's institutional power is enough to simply quash that. it is the fact that Germany was unstable anyway that prevented a united front that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand. Does it make sense?
Yes, absolutely. A tricky question on this. Just to stay on this a little longer, because I am not sure how to think about it, is the World War Two versus the Holocaust.
When we were talking just now about the way the history unrolls itself and Hitler have been stopped and I do not quite know what to think about Hitler without the Holocaust, and perhaps in his thinking how essential the anti-Semitism and the hatred of Jews was, it feels to me that, I mean, I do not know if we were just talking about where did he pick up his hatred of the Jewish people?
There is there is stories in Vienna and so on that it almost is picking up. The idea of anti-Semitism as a really useful tool. As opposed to actually believing in this core, do you think World War Two, as it turned out and Hitler's, as he turned out, would be possible without anti-Semitism? Could we have avoided the Holocaust or was an integral part of the ideology of fascism and the Nazis?
Not an integral part of fascism? Because Mussolini really I mean, Mussolini did it to please Hitler, but it was not an integral part. what is interesting to me is that that is the big anomaly in the whole question, because anti-Semitism did not need to be a part of this at all. Right. Hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world. He was a believer that the Jews controlled things. Right. The Jews were responsible for both Bolshevism on one side and capitalism on the other.
They ruled the banks. I mean, the United States was a Jewish fied country, right?
Bolshevism was was a unified sort of a political.
In other words, he saw Jews everywhere and he had that line about it. The Jews of Europe force another war to Germany. they will pay the price or whatever. But then you have to believe that they are capable of that.
The Holocaust is a weird, weird sidebar to the whole thing. And here is what I have always found interesting. it is a sidebar that week in Germany because look at the First World War. Jews fought for Germany. Who was the most important?
And this is a very arguable point, but it is just the first one that pops into my head who was the most important Jewish figure that would have maybe been on the German side had the Germans had a non anti-Semitic? Well, listen, that whole war, I thought, oh, yes, that is right.
But but the whole I should point out that to say Germany or Europe or Russia or any of those things were not anti-Semitic is to do injustice to history. Right. Pogroms everywhere. I mean, yes, that is that it is standard operating procedure. What you see in the Hitlerian era is an absolute huge spike. Right, because the government has a conspiracy theory that the Jews have. it is funny because Hitler both thought of them as weak and super powerful at the same time.
Right. And and as an outsider, people that week in Germany, the whole idea of the blood and how that connects to Darwinism and all that sort of stuff is just weird, right?
A real outlier. But Einstein, let us just play with Einstein. If there is no anti-Semitism in Germany or none above the normal level, right, the baseline level design Stein leave along with all the other Jewish scientists and I mean, and what does Germany have as as increased technological and intellectual capacity if they stay right. it is something that actually weakened that state. it is a tragic flaw in the Hitlerian worldview. But it was so. And let me you had mentioned earlier, like maybe it was not integral to his character.
Maybe it was a wonderful tool for power. I do not think so. Somewhere along the line and really not at the beginning, this guy became absolutely obsessed with this conspiracy theory and Jews, and he surrounded himself with people and theorists.
I am going to use that word really, really sort of loosely who believe this, too. And so you have a cabal of people who are reinforcing this idea that the Jews control the world, that he called it international Jewry, was a huge part of the problem, and that because of that, they deserve to be punished. They were an enemy within all these kinds of things. it is a it is a nutty conspiracy theory that the government of one of the most I mean, the big thing with Germany was Culter, right?
They were they were they were a leading figure in in culture and philosophy and all these kinds of things, and that they could be overtaken with this wildly, wickedly weird conspiracy theory and that it would actually determine thing. I mean, Hitler was taking vast amounts of German resources and using it to wipe out this race when he needed them for all kinds of other things to fight a war of annihilation.
So that is the weirdest part of the whole Nazi phenomenon, is the the darkest possible silver lining to think about is that the Holocaust may have been and the hatred of the Jewish people may have been the thing that avoided Germany getting the nuclear weapons first. And if it is not, is not that a wonderful, historical, ironic twist that if it were not so overlaid with tragedy a thousand years from now will be seen as something really kind of funny?
Well, that is true. it is fascinating to think. As you have talked, though, the seeds of his own destruction.
Right. The tragic flaw. And my hope is. This is a discussion I have with my dad as a physicist. Is that evil? Inherently contains with it that kind of incompetence. So. My dad's discussions. he is a physicist and an engineer. His belief is that at this time in our history, the reason we have not had nuclear like terrorist. Blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in the world. Is that the kind of people that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough?
At their job of being destructive, so there is a kind of if you plotted, the more evil you are, the less able you are. And by evil, I mean. Purely just like we said, if we were to consider the hatred of the Jewish people as evil because it is sort of detached from reality, it is like like just this pure hatred of something that is grounded on things, you know, conspiracy theories.
If that is evil, then the more you sell yourself, the more you give in to these conspiracy theories, the less capable you are actually engineering, which is very difficult, engineering nuclear weapons and effectively deploying them. So that is that is a hopeful message that the destructive people in this world are, by their world view, incompetent in creating the ultimate destruction.
I do not agree with that.
Oh, boy. I straight up do not agree with that. So why we are still here, why have not we destroyed ourselves? Why have not the terrorists blow? it is been many decades. Why have not we destroyed ourself to this point?
Well, when you say it is been many decades, many decades, that is like saying in the in the life of one hundred and fifty year old person, we have been doing well for a year.
The problem the problem with all these kinds of equations and it was Bertrand Russell, right. That the philosopher who said so, he said it was it is unreasonable to expect a man to walk on a tightrope for 50 years. I mean, the problem is, is that this is a long game. And let us remember that up until relatively recently, what would you say, 30 years ago, the nuclear weapons in the world were really tightly controlled. That was one of the real dangers in the fall of the Soviet Union.
Remember, the the the worry that that all of a sudden you were going to have bankrupt former Soviet republics selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot? I would suggest and here is another problem, is that when we call these terrorist evil, it is easy for an American, for example, to say that Osama bin Laden is evil. Easy for me to say that. But one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, as the saying goes. And to other people, he is not what Osama bin Laden did and the people that worked with him, we would call evil genius, the idea of hijacking planes and flying them into the buildings like that and that he could pull that off.
And that still boggles my mind. I am still it is funny. I am still stunned by that. And yet, you know, the idea here is the funny part. And I do not I hesitate to talk about this because I do not want to give anyone ideas. Right. But you do not need nuclear weapons to do incredibly grave amounts of danger. Yes, really. I mean, what one can of gasoline and a big lighter can do in the right place and the right time and over and over and over again can bring down societies.
This is the argument behind the importance of the stability that a nation state provides. So when we went in and took out Saddam Hussein, one of the great counterarguments from some of the people who said this is a really stupid thing to do is that Saddam Hussein was the greatest anti terror weapon in that region that you could have because they were a threat to him. So he took that and he did it in a way that was much more repressive than we would ever be.
Right. And this is the old line about why we supported right wing death squad countries, because they were taking out people that would inevitably be a problem for us if they did and they were able to do it in a way we would never be able to do. Supposedly we are pretty good at that stuff. You know, just like the Soviet Union was behind the scenes and underneath the radar. But the idea that the stability created by powerful and strong centralized leadership allowed them, it is almost like outsourcing anti-terror activities allowed them to for their own reasons.
I mean, you see the same thing in the Syria situation with the Assads. I mean, you can not have an ISIS in that area because that is a threat to the Assad government who will take care of that for you. And then that helps us by not having an ISIS. So I would suggest, one, that the game is still on, on whether or not these people get nuclear weapons in their hands. I would suggest they do not need them to achieve their goals.
Really.
The crazy thing is if you start thinking like the Joker in Batman, the terrorist ideas, it is funny. I guess I would be a great terrorist because I am just full of those idiot. Oh, you could do this.
it is scary to think of how vulnerable we are, but the whole point is that you as the Joker would not do the terrorist actions. that is the that is the theory that is so hopeful to me with my dad, is that all the ideas, your ability to generate good ideas, what forget nuclear weapons, how you can disrupt the power grid and how you can disrupt the attack.
Our psychology attack, like with a can of gasoline, like you said, somehow disrupt the American system of ideas like. That coming up with good ideas there. Are we saying evil people can not come up with evil genius idea?
that is what I am saying. We have this Hollywood story. I do not think history backs that up.
I mean, I think you can say with the nuclear weapons it does, but only because they are so recent. But I mean, evil genius. I mean, it is almost proverbial, but that is OK.
So the push back for the fun of it or I do not mean to I do not want you to leave this in a terrible mood because I push back every hopeful idea, but I tend to be a little cynical about that stuff. But but that goes to the definition of evil, I think, because I am not so sure human history has a lot of evil people being competent. I do believe that they mostly like in order to be good at doing what may be perceived as evil, you have to be able to construct an ideology around which you truly believe when you look in the mirror by yourself that you are doing good for the world.
And it is difficult to construct an ideology where destroying the lives of millions or disrupting the American system.
I am already contradicting myself, as I was saying, to say people have done this already. Yes.
So I but but then it is the question of like about aliens with the. The idea that if the aliens are all out there, why have not they visited us the same question. If it is so easy to be evil, not easy. If it is possible to be evil, why have not we destroyed ourselves?
And your statement is from the context of history. The game is still on and it is just been a few years since we have found the tools to destroy ourselves and one of the challenges of our modern time. We do not often think about this pandemic kind of revealed how soft we have gotten in terms of our deep dependence on the system.
So somebody mentioned to me, you know, what happens if power goes out for a day? What happens if power goes out for a month or for the person that mentioned this was a Berkeley faculty that I was talking with. he is an astronomer who is observing solar flares. And it is very possible that a solar flare, they happen all the time to different degrees. Look at your cell phones to knock out the power grid for months.
Hmm.
So, like, you know, just as a thought experiment, what happens if just power goes out for a week in this country, like the electromagnetic magnetic pulses in the nuclear weapons and all those kinds of things?
But maybe that is an act of nature. Yes.
And even just the act of nature will reveal like a little fragility, the fragility of it all, and then the evil can emerge.
I mean, the kind of things that might happen when power goes out, especially during a divisive time.
Well, you will not have food at baseline level. That would mean that the the the entire supply chain begins to break down and then you have desperation and desperation opens the door to everything.
Can I ask a dark question as opposed to the other things we have been talking about? Well, there is always a thread, a hopeful message.
I think it will be a hopeful message on this one, too. May have the wrong guess.
If you were to bet money on the way that human civilization destroys itself or it collapses in some way, that is where the result would be unrecognizable to us as anything akin to progress. What would you say?
Is it nuclear weapons? Is it some societal breakdown through just more traditional kinds of war? Is it engineered pandemics, nanotechnology's, that artificial intelligence? Is it something we can even expect yet? Do you have a sense of how we humans will destroy ourselves or might we live forever?
I think what governs my view of this thing is, is the ability for us to focus ourselves collectively. Right. And that gives me the choice of looking at this and saying, what are the odds we will do X versus Y? Right. So go look at the 62 Cuban missile crisis where we looked at the potential of nuclear war and we stared right in the face of that. To me, I consider that to be you want to talk about a hopeful moment.
that is one of the rare times in our history where I think the odds were overwhelmingly that there would be a nuclear war. And I am not the super Kennedy worshipper that I grew up in an era where he was especially amongst people in the Democratic Party. He was almost worshipped and I was never that guy. But I will say something. John F. Kennedy by himself probably made decisions that saved a hundred million or more lives because everyone around him thought he should be taking the road that would have led to those deaths.
And to push back against that is when you look at it now, I mean, again, if you were a betting person, you would have bet against that. And that is rare, right? So so when we talk about how the world will end, the fact that one person actually had that in their hands meant that it was not a collective decision it gave. Remember, I said I trust people on an individual level, but when we get together, we are more like a herd and we devolve down to the lowest common denominator.
That was something where the higher ethical ideas of a single human being could come into play and make the decisions that that influenced the events. But when we have to act collectively, I get a lot more pessimistic. So take what we are doing to the planet and we talk about it always now in terms of climate change, which I think is far too narrow. Look at, you know, and I always get very frustrated when we talk about these arguments about is it happening?
Is human. Just look at the trash. Forget forget climate for a second. we are destroying the planet because we are not taking care of it. And because what it would do to take care of it would require collective sacrifices that would require enough of us to say, OK, and we can not get enough of us to say OK, because too many people have to be on board. it is not John F. Kennedy making one decision from one man. We have to have eighty five percent of us or something around the world.
Not just you can not say we are going to stop doing damage to the to the to the world here in the United States if China does it right. So the amount of people that have to get on board that train is hard. You get pessimistic hoping for those kinds of shifts, unless it is right at Krypton's about to explode. We have. And so I think if you are talking about a gambling man's view of this, that that is got to be the odds on favorite because it requires such a union.
I mean, and the systems maybe are not even in place. Right. The fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies that are completely discredited now on board and you would have to subvert the national interests of nation states. I mean, the the amount of things that have to go right in a short period of time where we do not have six hundred years to figure this out. Right. So to me, that that looks like the most likely just because the things we would have to do to avoid it seem the most unlikely.
Does that make sense?
Yes, absolutely. I believe call me naive and just like you said, with the individual.
I believe that charismatic leaders, individual leaders will save us like this. You do not get them all at the same time. What if you get a charismatic leader in one country? But what if you get a charismatic leader in a country that does not really matter that much?
Well, it is a ripple effect. So it starts with one leader and their charisma inspires other leaders like. So it is like one and queen steps up and then the rest of the answers behaving. And then there is like little other spikes of leaders that emerge. And then that is where collaboration emerges. I tend to believe that, like when you heat up the system and shit starts getting really chaotic, then the leader, whatever this collective intelligence that we have developed, the leader will emerge like there.
Do you think there is just as much of a chance, though, that the leader would emerge and say the Jews are the people who did all this right? You know, what I am saying is that the idea that they would come up, you have a charismatic leader and he is going to come up with the rights or she is going to come up with the right solution as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution. I mean, I guess what I am saying is you could be right, but a lot of things have to go the right way.
But my intuition about the evolutionary process that led to the creation of human intelligence and consciousness on Earth results in the power of like, if we think of it, just the love in the system versus the hate in the system, that the love is greater. The human the the human kindness potential in the system is greater than the human hatred potential. And so the leader that is in the time when it is needed, the leader that inspires love and kindness, will is more likely to emerge and will have more power.
So you have the Hitlers of the world that emerge, but they are actually in the grand scheme of history are not that impactful. So it is weird to say, but not that many people died in World War Two.
If you look at the full range of human history, you know, it is up to one hundred million, whatever that is with natural pandemics to you can have those kinds of numbers, but it is still a percentage figure with the percentages, maybe three, five percent of the human population on earth. Maybe it is a little bit focused on a different region, but it is not destructive to the entirety of human civilization. So the I believe that the. The charismatic leaders one time is needed that do good for the world in the broader sense of good, are more likely to emerge than the ones that say kill all the Jews.
It is possible, though, and this is just you know, I have thought about this all of 30 seconds, but I mean, it is spending money here.
And on the twenty first century, who is going to win?
I think maybe you have divided this into too much of a black and white dichotomy, this love and good on one side, in this evil on another. Let me throw something that might be more in the center of that linear a balancing act self-interest which may or may not be good. You know, the good version of it we call enlightened self-interest. Right. The bad version of it we call selfishness. But self-interest, to me seems like something more likely to impact the outcome than either love on one side or evil on the other.
Simply a question of what is good for me or what is good for my country or what is good from my point of view, or what is good for my business. I mean, if you tell me and it may maybe I am a I am a coal miner or maybe I own a coal mine, if you say to me, we have to stop using coal because it is hurting the Earth, I have a hard time disentangling that greater good question from my right now.
Good feeding my family question. Right. So I think I think maybe it is going to be a much more banal thing than good and evil, much more a question of we are not all going to decide at the same time that the interests that we have are aligned. Does that make sense? Totally.
But I mean, I have looked at Ayn Rand and Objectivism kind of really thought like, how bad or good can things go when everybody's acting selfishly? But I think we are just talking to aunts here with microphones, talking about microphones.
But like the the question is when they when this spreads. So what is what do I mean by love and kindness? I think it is human flourishing on earth and throughout the cosmos. It feels like whatever the engine that drives human beings is more likely to result in human flourishing. And people like Hitler are not good for human flourishing.
So that is what I mean by good, is there is is there is I mean, maybe it is an intuition that kindness is an evolutionary advantage.
I hate those terms. I hate to reduce stuff to evolutionary biology always.
But it just seems like for us to multiply throughout the universe is good to be kind to each other.
And those leaders will always emerge to save us from the Hitlers of the world that want to kind of burn the thing down with a flame thrower.
that is the intuition. Well, let us talk about you brought up evolution several times. Let me let me play with that for a minute.
I think going back to animal times, we are conditioned to deal with overwhelming threats right in front of us. So I have quite a bit of faith in humanity when it comes to impending doom right outside our door. If Krypton's about to explode, I think humanity can rouse themselves to great and would give power to the people who needed it and be willing to make the sacrifices. But that is what makes, I think, the pollution, climate change, you know, screwing up your environment.
A threat so particularly insidious is it happens slowly, right? It defies fight and flight mechanisms. It defies the natural ability we have to deal with the threat that is right on top of us. And it requires an amount of foresight that while some people would would be fine with that, most people are too worried and understandably, I think too worried about today's threat rather than next generation's threat or whatever it might be. So, I mean, when we talk about when you said, what do you think the greatest threat is?
I think with nuclear weapons, I think, could we have a nuclear war? We darn right could. But I think that there is enough of of inertia. we are against that because people understand instinctively if I decide to launch this attack against China and I am India, we are going to have 50 million dead people tomorrow. Whereas if you say we are going to have a whole planet of dead people in three generations, if we do not start now, I think the evolutionary way that we have have have evolved mitigates maybe against that.
In other words, I think I would be pleasantly surprised if we could pull that off. Does that make sense?
Totally. I do not mean to be like the doom was as fun that way. I think we are both maybe I am over the top on the left, maybe I am over the top on the do. So it makes it makes for a fun chat, I think. So one one guy that I have talked to several times is slowly becoming a friend, is a guy named Elon Musk. he is a big fan of hardcore history. And especially Genghis Khan series of episodes, but really all of it him and is his girlfriend, Grymes, listen to it.
I know got you know, you are awesome. So that is like relationship goals, like listen to hardcore history and the weekend with your loved one.
OK, so let me if I were to look at the guy from a perspective of human history, it feels like he will be a little speck that is remembered. Oh, you think of all the people.
What will we remember from our time? Who are the people will remember whether it is the the Hitlers or the Einsteins, who is going to be hard to predict when you are in it. But it seems like Elon will be one of those people remembered. And if I were to guess what he is remembered for, it is the work he is doing with SpaceX and potentially being the person now we do not know. But the being the person who launched a new era of space exploration. If we look, you know, centuries from now, if we are successful as human beings, surviving long enough to venture out into the top of the stars, it is weird to ask you this.
I do not know what your opinions are, but do you think humans will be a multi planetary species in the long arc of history? Do you think Elon will be successful in his dream? And he does not he does not shy away from saying it this way. Right. He really wants us to colonize Mars first and then colonize other Earth like planets in other solar systems throughout the galaxy. Do you ever hope that we humans will venture out towards the stars? So here is the thing, and this actually, again, dovetails to what we were talking about earlier, I actually first of all, I toured Space X, and it is when you it is hard to get your mind around because he is doing what it took governments to do before.
Yes. OK, so it is incredible that we are watching individual companies and stuff doing this, doing it faster and cheaper. Yeah, well. And pushing the envelope right. Faster than the governments at the time were moving it. It really is. I mean, there is a lot of people who I think who think Elon is is overrated and you have no idea. Right. When you go see it, you have no idea. But that is actually not what I am most impressed with.
it is Tesla I am most impressed with. And the reason why is because in my mind, we just talked about what I think is the greatest threat, the environmental stuff. And I talked about our inability maybe all at the same time, to be willing to sacrifice our self interests in order for the for the goal. And I do not want to put words in Ilan's mouth so you can you can talk to him if you want to. But in my mind, what he is done is recognize that problem.
And instead of building a car, that is a piece of crap. But, you know, it is good for the environment, so you should drive it. he is trying to create a car that if you are only motivated by your self-interest, you will buy it anyway and it will help the environment and help us transition away from one of the main causes of damage. I mean, one of the things is pandemic. And the shut down around the world has done is show us how amazingly quickly the earth can actually rejuvenate.
we are seeing clear skies in places species come and you would have thought it would have taken decades for some of this stuff. So what if to name just one major pollution source, we did not have the pollution caused by automobiles. Right. And and if if you had said to me, Dan, what do you think the odds of us transitioning away from that were 10 years ago? I would have said, well, people are not going to do it because it is inefficient at this that nobody wants to go.
But what if you created a vehicle that was superior in every way so that if you were just a self oriented consumer, you would buy it because you wanted that car? that is the best way to get around that problem of people not wanting. I think he is identified that. And as he is told me before, you know, when the last time a car company was created that actually, you know, blah, blah, blah, he is right. And so I happen to feel that even though he is pushing the envelope on the space thing, I think somebody else would have done that someday.
I am not sure because of the various things he is mentioned, how difficult it is to start. I am not sure that the industries that create vehicles for us would have gone where he is going to lead them if he did not force them there through consumer demand by making a better car that people wanted. Anyway, they will follow, they will copy, they will do all those things. And yet who was going to do that? So I hope he does not hate me for saying this, but I happen to think the Tesla idea may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet because the planet is being destroyed.
Right. And we are going to colonize Mars probably anyway if we live long enough. And I think the Tesla idea, not just Ellen's version, but ones that follow from other people, is the best chance of making sure we are around long enough to see Mars colonized. Does that make sense?
Yeah, totally. And one other thing, from my perspective, because I am now starting a company, I think the interesting thing about Elon is he serves as a beacon of hope, like pragmatically speaking, for people that sort of to push back on our doom conversation from earlier, that a single individual could build something that allows us self-interested individuals to gather together in a collective way to actually alleviate some of the dangers that face our world.
So it gives me hope as an individual that I can build something that can actually have impact, that counteracts the the Stalins and the Hitlers and all the threats that face that human civilization faces, that an individual has that power.
I did not believe that the individual has that power in the in the halls of government. Like, I do not feel like any one presidential candidate can rise up and help the world unite the world. It feels like from everything I have seen and you are right with Tesla, it can bring the world together to do good.
that is a really powerful mechanism of, you know, whatever you say about capitalism, that you can build companies that. Start, you know, starts with a single individual, of course, is a collective that grows around that, but the leadership of a single individual, their ideas, their dreams, their vision can catalyze something that takes over the world and does good for the entire world.
But if I think but again, I think the genius of the idea is that it does not require us to go head to head with human nature.
Right. He he is he is actually built human nature into the idea by basically saying, I am not asking you to be an environmental activist. I am not asking you to sacrifice to make it. I am going to sell you a car you are going to like better. And by buying it, you will help the environment that takes into account our foibles as a species and actually leverages that to work for the greater good. And that is the sort of thing that does turn off my little doom Caster's cynicism thing a little bit, because you are actually hitting us where we live, right?
you are you are you are not you can take somebody who does not even believe the environment's a problem, but they want a Tesla, so they are inadvertently helping anyway.
I think that is the genius of the idea. Yeah.
And I am telling you, that is one way to make love much more efficient mechanism of change than hate.
Making it in your self-interest to make is just creating a product that leads to more love than than hate.
you are going to want to love your neighbor because you are going to make a fortune. And there you go. that is why I am on board.
that is why Elon said loves the answer. that is, I think, exactly what he meant.
OK, let us try something difficult.
you have recorded an episode of Staring into the Iceberg on your common sense program.
Yeah, that has started a lot of conversations is quite moving. It was quite haunting me.
A lot of angry emails, really.
Of course. I did something I have not done in 30 years, I endorsed a political candidate for one of the two main parties and there were a lot of disillusioned people because of that.
I guess I did not hear it as an endorsement. I just heard it as a. The similar flavor of conversations you have in hardcore history, some of the speaking about modern times in the same voice as you speak about when you talk about history.
So it was just a little bit of a haunting view of the world today. I know we were just wearing our doom. Do I put that right back on? Are, you know, the I like the term doom caster?
Is is there is there, um, how do we get loved to win? what is the way out of this, is there some hope for. Line that we can walk to to avoid something, and I hate to use the terminology, but something that looks like a civil war.
Not necessarily a war of force, but a division to a level where does not any longer feel like a United States of America with the emphasis on United.
Is there a way out? I read a book a while back.
I want to say George Friedman, the Stratfor guy, wrote it was something called The Next Hundred Years, I think it was called. And I remember thinking.
I did not agree with any of it. And one of the things I think he said in the book was that, you know, the United States was going to break up. I am going from memory here. He might have said that at all. But something was stuck in my memory about that.
I remember thinking, but I think some of the arguments were connected to the differences that we had and the fact that those differences are being exploited. So we talked about media earlier and the lack of truth. And I mean, we have a media climate that is incentivized to take the wedges in our society and make them wider. And there is no countervailing force to do the opposite or to help to, you know. So there was a famous memo from a group called Project for a New American Century, and they took it down.
But the Wayback Machine online still has it. And it happened before 9/11, spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories because it was saying something to the effect of and I am really paraphrasing here, but you know that that the United States needs another Pearl Harbor type event because those galvanize a country that, without those kinds of events periodically is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart. And it is those periodic events that act as the countervailing force that otherwise is not there. If that is true, then we are naturally inclined towards pulling ourselves apart.
So to have a media environment that makes money off widening those divisions, which we do, I mean, I was in talk radio and it it has those people, the people that used to scream at me because I would not do it. But I mean, we would have these terrible conversations after every broadcast where I would be in there with the program director and they are yelling at me about heat. Heat was the word. They create more heat. What is heat?
Right. He just division. Right. And they want the heat not because they are political. they are not Republicans or Democrats either. they are we want listeners and we want engagement and involvement. And because of the constructs of the format, you do not have a lot of time to get it. So you can not have me giving you, like on a podcast an hour and a half or two hours where we build a logical argument and you are with me the whole way.
Your audience is changing every 15 minutes. So whatever points you make to create interest and intrigue and engagement have to be knee jerk right now. They told me once that the audience has to know where you stand on every single issue within five minutes of turning on your show.
In other words, you have to be part of a of a linear set of political beliefs so that if you feel a about subject A, then you must feel good about a subject. do not even need to hear your opinion on it, because if you feel that way about it, you are going to feel that way about this. This is a system that is designed to pull us apart for profit, but not because they want to pull us apart. Right.
it is a byproduct of the profit.
that is one little example of of 50 examples in our society that work in that same fashion. So what that project for a new American Century document was saying is that we are naturally inclined towards disunity and without things to occasionally ratchet that unity back up again so that we can start from the baseline again and then pull ourselves apart till the next Pearl Harbor that you will pull yourself apart, which I think was I think that is what the George Friedman book was saying, that I disagree with so much at the time.
So in answer to your question about civil wars, we can not have the same kind of civil war because we do not have a geographical division that is as clear cut as the one we had before. Right. You had a basically north south line and some border states. It was set up for that kind of split. Now we are divided within communities, within families, within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts. Right. So you can not disengage. we are stuck with each other. So if there is a civil war now.
For lack of a better word, what it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s, where you had the bombings and, you know, let us call it domestic terrorism and things like that, because that that would seem to be something that, once again, you do not even need a large chunk of the country pulling apart 10 percent of people who think it is it is the end times can do the damage, just like we talked about terrorism before and a can of gas and a big lighter.
I have lived in a bunch of places and I will not give anybody ideas where a can of gas in a big lighter would take a thousand houses down before you could blink. Right.
That terrorist does not have to be from the Middle East, does not have to have some sort of a fundamentalist religious agenda. It could just be somebody really pissed off about the election results. So once again, if we are playing an odds game here, everybody has to behave for this to work, right? Only a few people have to misbehave for this thing to go sideways. And remember, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So you do not even have to have those people doing all these things.
All they have to do is start the retribution cycle. And there is an escalation. Yes. And it go and it creates a momentum of its own, which leads fundamentally, if you follow the chain of events down there to some form of dictatorial government as the only way to create stability. Right. You want to destroy the republic and have a dictator. that is how you do. And there are parallels to Nazi Germany, the burning of the Reichstag, you know, blah, blah, blah.
I am the doom caster again, know well.
And some of it could be manufactured by those seeking authoritarian policies like the Reichstag fire was or the Polish soldiers that fired over the border before the invasion in 1939 to fight the the devil's advocate with an angel's advocate.
I would say, just as our conversation about Elian, it feels like individuals have power to unite us to to be that force of unity. So you mentioned the media.
I think you are one of the great podcasters in history. Joe Rogan is like a long form, whatever.
it is not podcasting. it is actually whatever the very infrequent is what it is, no matter what it is.
But the basic process of it is you go deep and you stay deep and the listener stays with you for a long time.
So I am just looking at the numbers like we are.
Almost three hours in and away from previous episodes, I can tell you that about three hundred thousand people are still listening to the sound of our voice three hours in. So usually three hundred to five hundred thousand people listen and they tune.
By the way, that is wonderful. Joe Rogan is like 10 times that. And so he has. Power. To unite, you have power to unite, there is a few people with voices that it feels like they have power to unite. Even if you if you, quote, unquote, endorse a candidate and so on, there is still it feels to me that speaking of.
I do not want to keep saying love, but it is love and maybe unity, more practically speaking, that like sanity, that like respect for those you do not agree with or do not understand. So empathy was just a few voices of those can help us avoid the really importantly, not avoid the singular events, like you said, of somebody starting a fire and so on, but avoid the escalation of it, the preparedness of the populace to escalate those events to, you know, to to turn a singular event and a single riot or a shooting or like even something much more dramatic than that, to turn that into something that creates like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples that fade away.
And so, like, I would like to put responsibility on somebody like you and me in some small way.
And Joe, being cognizant of the fact that a lot of very destructive things might happen in November.
And a few voices can save us is the feeling I have now by saying we should vote for or any of that kind of stuff, but really by being the the the voice of calm that like comes the the seas from or whatever the analogy is from boiling up because I truly am worried about.
This is the first time this year when I. I sometimes I somehow felt that the American project will go on forever. When I came to this country, I just believed and I think I am young, but like, you know, I have a dream of creating a company that will do a lot of good for the world. And I thought that America is the beacon of hope for the world and the ideas of freedom, but also the idea of empowering companies that can do some good for the world.
And I am just worried about this America that filled me a kid that came from our family came from nothing and from Russia as it was Soviet Union, as it was to be able to do anything in this new country.
I am just worried about it. And it feels like a few people can still keep this project going.
I think people like Elon, people like Joe. Is there? Do you have a bit of that hope I am watching this experiment with social media right now and I mean, social media really expand that out to me. I feel like we are all guinea pigs right now watching. You know, I have two kids and just watch. And there is a three year space between the two of them. One's 18, the other's 15. And just in when I was a kid, a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different.
Just three years difference, more maturity. But their life experiences, you would easily classify those two people as being in the same generation. Now, because of the speed of technological change, there is a vast difference between my 18 year old and my 15 year old and not in immaturity question, just in what apps they use, how they relate to each other, how they deal with their peers, their social skills, all those kinds of things where you turn around and go, this is uncharted territory.
we have never been here. So it is going to be interesting to see what effect that has on society. Now, as that relates to your question, the most upsetting part about all that is reading how people treat each other online. And, you know, there is lots of theories about this, the fact that some of it is just for trolling laughs that some of it is just people are not interacting face to face, so they feel free to treat each other that way.
And I of course, I am trying to figure out how how if this is how we have always been as people. Right. we have always been this way, but we have never had the means to post our feelings publicly about it, or if the environment and the social media and everything else has provided a change and changed us into something else. Either way, when one reads how we treat one another and the horrible things we say about one another online, which seems like it should not be that big of deal, they are just words, but they have a cumulative effect.
I mean, when you I was reading Meghan Markle, who I do not know a lot about, because it is it is too much of the pop side of culture for me to Pela. But I read a story the other day where she was talking about the abuse she took online and how incredibly overwhelming it was and how many people were doing it. And you think to yourself, OK, this is something that people who were in positions of what you were discussing earlier never had to deal with.
Let me ask you something. And boy, this is the ultimate doom caster thing of all time to say when you think of historical figures that push things like love and peace and and creating bridges between enemies. When you think of how what happened to those people, first of all, they are very dangerous. Every society in the world has a better time, easier time dealing with violence and things like that than they do nonviolence. Nonviolence is really difficult for governments to deal with.
For example, what happens to Gandhi and Jesus and Martin Luther King. And you think about all those people, right? When they are that it is it is ironic, is not it, that these people who push for peaceful solutions are so often killed, but it is because they are effective and when they are killed, the effectiveness is diminished. Why are they killed? Because they are effective. And the only way to stop them is to eliminate them because they are charismatic leaders who do not come around every day.
And if you eliminate them from the scene, the odds are you are not going to get another one for a while. I guess what I am saying is the very things you are talking about, which would have the effect you think it would. Right. They would destabilize systems in a way that most of us would consider positive. But those systems have a way of protecting themselves. Right. And so I feel like history shows the history is pretty pessimistic.
I think, by and large, if only because we can find so many examples that just sound passive. But I feel like people who are dangerous to the way things are tend to be removed.
Yes, but there is two things to say. I feel like you are right, that history. I feel like the ripples that love leaves in history are less obvious to detect, but are actually more transformational like no one could make a case about.
I mean, if you want to talk about the the long term value of a Jesus are gone. Yes. Yes. Those people's ripples are still affecting people today.
And that is you feel those ripples through the general improvement of the quality of life that we see in throughout the generations. Like you feel the ripples that go along with you on that.
OK, but I would even if that is not true now, I tend to believe that. And by the way, that the company that I am working on as a competitor is exactly attacking this, which is a competitor to Twitter. I think I can build a better Twitter as a first step.
there is a long story in there I think a three year old child could build. And this is not to denigrate you. I am sure yours would be better than what Twitter is. So and listen, Facebook, Twitter, they are really awful platforms for intellectual discussion and meaningful discussion. But when I am on it, so let me just say I am part of the problem.
we are new to this. So it was not obvious at the time how it is now and now a three year old.
Can I do I tend to believe that we live in a time where the tools that people that are interested in providing love, like the weapons of love, are much more powerful.
So, like, the one nice thing about technology is it allows anyone to build a company that is more powerful than any government. So that could be very destructive, but it could be also very positive. And that is I tend to believe that somebody like Elon that wants to do good for the world, somebody like me and many like me could have more power than any one government to.
And by power, I mean the power to affect change, which is different from gone with government.
And I do not mean to interrupt you, but I will forget my train of thought gets old. And I mean, how do you deal with the fact that already governments who are afraid of this are walling off their own Internet systems as a way to create firewalls simply to prevent you from doing what you are talking about? In other words, if you know there is an old line that if voting really changed anything, they would never allow it.
If if love through a modern day successor to Twitter would really do what you want it to do and this would destabilize governments. Do you think that governments would would take countermeasures to squash that love before it got too dangerous?
there is several answers. One, first of all, I do not actually to push back on something you said earlier, I do not think love is as much of an enemy of the state as as one would think.
Different states have different views, I. I think the states want power, and I do not always think that love is in tension with power like I think. And. I think it is not just about love, it is about rationalities reason, it is empathy, all of those things, I do not necessarily think there always have to be by definition, in conflict with each other. So that is one senses. I feel like basically you can Trojan Horse love into being behind, but you have to be good at it.
This is the thing. If you have to be conscious of the way these states think so the fact that China banned certain services and so on, that means the the companies were not eloquent. Whoever the companies are were not actually good at infiltrating like I think is not in a song like Love is a Battlefield.
I think it is all a competitor. Yeah, it is all a game.
And you have to be good at the game. And just like Elon, who said, you know, Tesla and saving the environment, I mean, that is not just by getting on a stage and saying it is important to save the environment is by building a product that people can not help but love and then convincing Hollywood stars to love it like there is there is a game to be played.
OK, so let me let me build on that, because I think there is a way to see this. I think you are right. And so it has to do with a story about the 1960s. In the vast scheme of things, the 1960s looks like a revival of neo romantic ideas. Right. I had a buddy of mine several years ago, two decades older than I was, who was in the 60s, went to the protest, did all those kind of things.
And we were talking about it and I was romanticizing it. And he said, do not romanticize. Because let me tell you, most of the people that went to those protests and did all those things, all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time. And, you know, it was it was not so, but. It became in vogue to have in other words, let us talk about your empathy and love, you are never going to, in my opinion, grab that great mass of people that are only in it for their interest in whatever.
But if meeting girls for a young teenage guy requires you to feign empathy, requires you to read deeper subjects, because that is what people are into. You can almost as as a silly way to be trendy, you could make maybe empathy, trendy love, trendy solutions that that are the opposite of that, the kind of things that people inherently will not put up with. In other words, the possibility exists to change the zeitgeist and reorient it in a way that even if most of the people are not serious about it, the results are the same.
Does that make sense? Absolutely. OK. OK, so we have found a meeting of the month.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Creating creating incentives that, uh, that encourage the best and the most beautiful aspects of human nature will continue.
It all boils down to meeting girls and boys. Once again, you are getting to the bottom of the evolutionary motivations and you are always on safe ground. Can you do that?
Yeah, it is a little difficult for me of you know, and I am sure it is actually difficult for you to listen to me say complimenting you, but it is good that it is as difficult for both of us.
OK, so but, you know, you and I, as I mentioned to you, I think I have been friends for a long time, which has been one way. So like I have to say now to a story now. So, like, that is the beauty of podcasting, you know? I mean, now just been fortunate enough with this particular podcast that I see in people's eyes when they meet me, that they have been friends with me for for for a few years now.
And and we become fast friends actually after we start talking. But it is one way in the vet and the first moment, you know, like there is something about especially hardcore history that, you know, I do some crazy challenges and running and stuff. I remember in particular probably do not have time. One of my favorite episodes, the painful tainment one, some people hate that because it is too real.
it is my darkest when we wanted to set a baseline, that is the baseline.
But I remember listening to that and when I ran twenty two miles from long distance and how that is made for tainment.
Right. And it just pulls you in. And there is something so powerful about this particular creation that is bigger than you actually that you have created. it is kind of interesting. I think anything that is successful like that, like the stuff to it becomes bigger than you. And that is that is what you are hoping for, right? Absolutely. I did not mean to interrupt you.
I guess one question I have, if you look in the mirror, but you also look at me. What advice would you give to yourself and to me and to other podcasters, maybe to Joe Rogan about this journey that we are on? I feel like it is something special, I am not sure exactly what is happening, but it feels like podcasting a special. What advice, and I am relatively new to it. What advice do you have for for people that are carrying this flame and traveling in this journey?
Well, I am often asked for advice by new podcasters, people just starting out, and so I have sort of a a tried and true list of do's and don'ts and but I do not have advice or suggestions for you or for Joe.
Joe does not need anything from me. Joe's figured it out. Right. And he has. And yet he is still a confused kid, curious about the world. But that is the genius of it. that is what makes it work, right? that is what that is what Joe's brand is. Right.
I guess what I am saying is that by the time you reach the stage that you are at or Joe's that they do not need, they have figured this out. The people that sometimes need help are brand new people trying to figure out what do I do with my first show and how do I talk to them? And I have standard answers for that. But you found your niche. I mean, you do not need me to tell you what to do. As a matter of fact, I might ask you questions about how do you do what you do.
Right.
Well, there is I guess there is specific things that we were talking offline about monetization. that is a fascinating one.
Very difficult as an independent. Yeah.
And one of the things that Joe is facing with I do not know if you are paying attention, but he joined Spotify with the one hundred million dollar deal for going exclusive on their platform. The idea of exclusivity, that one, I do not give a damn about money personally, but I am single and I like living in a shitty place, so I enjoy it.
So I guess it makes it easier to get the freedom right to freedom. Materials is not safe for anybody's college. Exactly. Yeah.
OK, so on that point. But I also look, maybe it is romanticisation, but I feel like podcasting is pirate radio. And when I first heard about Spotify partnering up with Joe, I was like, you know, fuck the man.
I said I even I drafted a few tweets and so on, just like attacking Spotify. Then I call myself down that you can not lock up this special thing we have. But then I realized that maybe that these are vehicles for just reaching more people and actually respecting podcasters more and so on. So that is what I mean by it is unclear what the journey is, because you also serve as a beacon. For now. there is like millions, one million plus podcasters.
I wonder what the journey is. Do you have a sense? Are you romantic in the same kind of way and feeling that because you have roots in radio too? Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio or is the Spotify thing one possible avenue? Are you nervous about Joe as a fan, as a friend of Joe, or is this is a good thing for us?
So my history of how I got involved in podcasting is interesting. I was in radio and then I started a company back in the era where the dotcom boom was happening and everybody was being bought up. And it just seemed like a great idea. Right started. I did it with seven other six other people.
And the whole goal of the company was we we had to invent the term. I am sure everybody there is other places that invented it at the same time. But what we were pitching to investors was something called amateur content. So this is before YouTube, before podcasting, before all this stuff. And I my job was to be the evangelist and I would go to these people and and sing the praises of all the ways that amateur content was going to be great.
And I never got a bite. And they all told me the same thing. This is not going to take off because anybody who is good is already going to be making money at this. And I kept saying, forget that we are talking about scale here. If you have millions of pieces of content being made every week, a small percentage is going to be good no matter what. Right. 16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like. And I kept pushing this nobody bit.
But the podcast grew out of that because if you are talking about amateur content in nineteen ninety nine, well, then you are already where you know you are ahead of the game in terms of not seeing where it is going to go financially, but seeing where it is going to go technologically.
And so when we started the podcast in 2005 and it was the political will not hardcore history, which was an outgrowth of the old radio show, we did not have any financial ideas. We were simply trying to get our handle on the technology and how you distribute it to people and all that. And it was years later that we tried to figure out, okay, how can we get enough money to just support us while we are doing this? And we and the cheap and the easy way was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind of model.
And that was that was the original model. So then once we started down that we figured out other models, the advertising thing, and we sell the old shows. And so all these became ways for us to support ourselves. But as as podcasting matured and as more operating systems developed and phones were developed and all these kinds of things, every one of those developments which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast, actually made it more complex to make money off of them.
Yes. So while our audience was building the amount of time and effort we had to put into the monetization side began to skyrocket. So to get back to your Spotify question, to use just one example, there is a lot of people who are doing similar things in this day and age, and we just sell MP three files. And all you had to have was an MP three player is cheap and dirty. Now, every time there is an OS upgrade, something breaks for us.
So we are having I mean, my choices are at this point to start hiring staff, more staff, you people, and then be a human resources manager. I mean, the pirate radio side of this was the pirate radio side of this because you did not need anybody but you or you in another. I mean, you could just do this lean and mean and it is becoming hard to do it lean and mean now. So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says, hey, we will handle that stuff for you.
In the past, I would just say F off we do not need. Yeah, yeah.
I do not mind. And I definitely am not making what we could make on this. But what we would have to do to make that is onerous to me. But it is becoming onerous to me day to day anyway. And so if somebody were to come in and say, hey, we will pick that up for you, we will not interfere with your content at all. We will not. In my case, you can not say we need a show a month because that are not happening.
Right. So, I mean, everybody's everybody's design is different, right? So it does not you know, there is not one size fits all. But I guess as a long time pirate podcasts are, there are you know, we have been looking to partner with people, but nobody's right for us to partner with me. So so I am always looking for ways to take that side of it off my plate because I am not interested in that side. All I want to do is the shows.
And it is really at this point, you should not call yourself an artist because, you know, that is something I have decided by.
But I mean what we are trying to do, art, and there is something very satisfying in that.
But the part that I can not stand is the increasing amount of time the monetization question takes on us.
And so there is a case to be made, I guess, is what I am saying, that if a partnership with some outside firm enhances your ability to do the art without. it is enhancing your ability to do the art, it is the word I am looking for here is it is it is it is enticing. Yes, I do not like big companies, so I am afraid of whatever strings might come with that. And if I am Joe Rogan and I am talking about subjects that can make company public companies a little nervous, I would certainly be careful.
But at the same time, people who are not in this game do not understand the problems that literally I mean, just all the operating systems, all the pod catchers, every time some new pop culture comes out, makes it easier to get the podcast. that is something we have to account for on the back end. And I am not exactly the technological wizard of all time, so I think it is maybe maybe the short answer is, is that as the medium develops, it is becoming something that you have to consider, not because you want to sell out, but because you want to keep going.
And it is becoming harder and harder to be pirate like in this environment was the thing that convinced me especially and says Spotify, is that they understand. So if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism, as you are saying, of big companies, then then it works because Spotify understands the magic that makes podcasting or they appear to in part, at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan. And despite what I do not know if you. So there is the Internet and there is people with opinions on the Internet.
Really? Yes. And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify. But the reality is there is two things in private conversation with Joe. And in general, there is two important things. One, Spotify literally does not tell Joe anything like all the people that think they the Spotify somehow pushing Joe in this direction. That tracks well, they did not did not he did not insist upon that.
it is in the contract. And also, you know, companies have a way of even with the contract you are due to be, you know, marketing people. I know enough.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You hate that. Yeah.
But Joe, with you it what you and Joe are the same. And Spotify is smart enough not to send a single email of that kind that is really smart. And they leave, they leave them be there is meetings and Spotify that like people read about, people complain. But those meetings never show that, that never that is a company stuff.
And the idea that Spotify is different than pirate radio, the the difficult thing about podcasting is nobody gives a damn about your podcasts. you are alone in this. I mean, there is fans and stuff, but nobody is looking out for you. Yeah, yeah.
And the nice thing about Spotify is they want Joe to Joe's podcast to succeed even more. that is what Joe talked about, is that is the difference between YouTube and Spotify. Spotify wants to be the Netflix of podcasting. And they like what Netflix does is they they they do not want to control you in any way, but they want to create a platform where you can flourish even as your interests are aligned interests.
So let me bring up let me bring up something that let us make a distinction, because not all companies who do this are the same. And you brought up YouTube and Spotify. But but to me, YouTube is at least more like Spotify than some of these smaller. The term is walled garden. Right. you have heard the term walled garden. OK, so I have been around podcasting so long now that I have seen rounds of consolidation over the years and they come in waves and all of a sudden so you will get and I am not going to mention any names, but but up until recently the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms compared to people like Spotify.
And the problem was, is that by deciding to consolidate your materials in a walled garden, you are walling yourself off from audience. Right. So your choices I am going to accept this amount of money from this company, but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience. And that is a catch 22 because you are negotiating power with that companies based on your audience size. So signing up with them diminishes your audience size.
You lose negotiating power, but when you get to the level of a Spotify to just pick them out, there is other players. But you brought up Spotify specifically.
These are people who can potentially potentially enhance your audience over time. And so the risk to you is lower because if you decide in a year or two, whatever the licensing agreements term is, that you are done with them and you want to leave instead of how you would have been with some of these smaller walled gardens where you are walking away with a fraction of the audience you walked in with, you have the potential to walk out with whatever you got in the original deal, plus a larger audience because their algorithms and everything are designed to push people to your content if they think you like.
So it takes away some of the downside risk which which alleviates. And if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan, I mean, where you have protected your your freedom to to put the content out the way you want. So and if some of the downside risk is mitigated and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize and stay up with the latest tech, then it might be worth it. You know, I am scared of things like that, but at the same time, I am trying to not be an idiot about it and I can be an idiot about it.
And when you have been doing it as independently for as long as I have, the inertia of that has a force all its own. But I am I am I am inhibited enough in what I am trying to do on this other end that it is opened me at least to listening to people. But listen, at the same time, I love my audience and it sounds like a cliche, but they are literally the reason I am here. So I want to make sure that whatever I do, if I can, is in keeping with a relationship that I have developed with these people over 15 years.
But like you said, no matter what you do, you are because see, here is the thing. If you do not sign up with one of those companies to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand. They might yell at you for how difficult it is because the new or the new, the new operating system just updated you. I can not get. So either way, you are opening yourself up to ridicule at this point. All of that makes it easier to go well if the right deal came along, were not screwing me and they were not screwing my audience.
Blah, you know, I mean, again, in this business, when you are talking about cutting edge technology that is ever changing and as you said, a million podcast and growing, I think you have to try to maintain flexibility and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk. I think you have to I think you would be an idiot to not at least try to stay up on the current trends. And look, I am watching Joe. I am going. Okay, let us see how it goes for Joe.
I mean, if he is like, oh, this is terrible.
I am getting out of this. You go those people around you. So Joe's just put himself out as a guinea pig and I and the rest of us are guinea pigs. Appreciate it. As a huge as a fan of your shows and as a fan of Netflix, the people there, I think I can speak for like millions of people in the hope that hardcore history comes to Netflix or Spotify becomes the Netflix of podcasting and the Spotify. there is something that is best that they bring out the you said artists.
So I could say it is they bring out the best out of the artists. They they remove some of the headache and somehow, like, they put. At their best, Netflix, for example, is able to enforce and find the beauty and the power in the creations that you make even better than you like, they do not interfere with the creations, but they somehow it is a branding thing, probably too interfering would be that would be a no go for.
that is right. Absolutely. That can not help. But that is why Netflix is masterful. They they seem to not interfere with the talent as opposed to could throw other people under the bus like a lot of places under the bus that could be thrown.
Absolutely.
So I would love I know there is probably people screaming. Yes. Right now in terms of hardcore history on Netflix would be awesome.
And I do not love asking this question, but it is probably the most popular question that is unanswerable, so let me try to ask it in a way that you would actually answer it, which is, of course, you said you do not release shows very often.
And the question is the requests and the questions is, what can you tell them to do on the civil war? Can you tell them to do one on the bottom part? Can you tell them to do one? You know, every every topic you have spoken to this actually your answer about the Civil War is quite interesting. I knew what my answer was. The civil war that you do not use as a military historian.
You enjoy in particular when there is differences in the armies as a contrast contrasts with the civil war, which they blew my mind when I heard you say is, you know, there is not an interesting, deep, intricate contrast between the two opposing sides, the Roman civil wars.
Which legionary against legionary? Yeah.
Is and you have also said that you kind of the shows you work on are ones where you have some roots of fundamental understanding about that period.
And and so, like, when you work on a show, it is basically like pulling at those strings further and like refreshing your mind and learning. Definitely done the research. Wow. These are like words out of my mouth. you are right.
So but is there something like like our thoughts on Reddit is there are some ideas that are like lingering in your head about possible future episodes. There are things that whether you are not committing to anything, but whether you are going to do it or not, is there something that is like makes you think that would be interesting to to pull at that thread a little bit? Oh, yeah, we have things we keep in our back pocket for later, so Blueprint for Armageddon, the First World War Series we did that was in my back pocket the whole time.
And when the centennial of the war happened, it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was that was a hell of a series. And that is probably one of my favorites or my rear end.
And I have to tell psychologically, you mean or just, you know, when you get to these, I think I am guessing here.
I think it is twenty six hours all pieces together. Think about and we do not do scripts. it is improvised.
So think about what Tony what I had somebody write on Twitter just yesterday saying he said something like, I am not seeing the dedication here. you are only getting two point five shows out a year. And I wanted to say, man, you have no idea what the only people who understand really our other history podcast and even they do not generally do twenty six hours. But, you know, that was a two year endeavor. As I said, the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes.
I could crank out one of those a month. But when you are doing I mean, the last show we did on the fall of the Roman Republic was five and a half hours. that is a book. Right? And it was part six or something.
So, I mean, you just do the math and you felt like you sorry to interrupt on World War One, it felt like you were emotionally pulled in to it like it felt taxing.
Because if that is a good thing, though, because, you know, and I think we said during the show that was the feeling that the people at the time have. And I think at one point we said it, this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive now. You know how the people at the time felt.
So, in other words, that had any sort of inadvertently because when you improvise a show, some of these things are inadvertent, but it it inadvertently created the right climate for having a sense of empathy with the storyline. And to me, that those are the serendipitous moments that make this art and not some sort of paint by the numbers kind of endeavor, you know, and that is to me that would not have happened had we scripted it out.
So it is mostly you just bring the tools of knowledge to the table and then in large part improvise like the actual wording.
I always say we make it like they made things like Spinal Tap and some of those other things where the material. So I do have notes about things like on page forty, twenty seven of this book. You have this so that I know. Aha. I am at the point where I can drop that in and sometimes I will write a note saying here is where you left off yesterday. So I remember, but in the improvisation you end up throwing a lot out and so like, like but it allows us to go off on tangents like we will try things like I will sit there and go, I wonder what this would sound like and I will spend two days going down that road and then I will listen to it does not work.
But that is, you know, like writers do this all the time. it is called killing your babies. Right? You can not, you know, but people go. So this guy goes, I am not seeing the dedication.
He has no idea how many things were thrown out. I did an hour and a half. I had an hour and a half into the current show about two months ago. And I listen to it. And I just went, you know what, it is not right.
Boom, out the window there goes six weeks of work. Right.
But here is the problem. Sorry to interrupt. Do you trust your judgment on that?
No, no. But but here is here is the here is the thing.
Our show is a little different than other people's. Joe Rogan called it evergreen content. In other words, my political show is like a car you buy. And the minute you drive it off the lot, it loses half its value. Right. Because it is not current anymore. These shows are just as good or just as bad five years from now as they are when we all know the standards on the Internet changed. So when I listen to my old shows, I cringe sometimes because the standards are so much higher now.
But when you are creating evergreen content, you have two audiences to worry about. You have the audience that is waiting for the next show and they have already heard the other ones and they are impatient and they are telling you on Twitter, where is it? But you have shown the shows also for people five years from now who have not discovered it yet and who do not care a whit for how long it took because they are going to be able to download the whole thing and all they care about is quality.
And so what I always tell new podcasters is they always say, I read all these things. it is very important you have a release schedule. Well, it is not more important than putting out a good piece of work.
And the audience will forgive me if it takes too long, but it is really good when you get it. They will not forgive me if I rush it to get it out on time and it is a piece of crap. So for us and this is why when you brought up a Spotify deal or anything else, they can not interfere with this at all because my my job here, as far as I am concerned, is quality and everything else goes by the wayside because the only thing people care about long term, the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it.
Right. How good is that book? If you read Jaara Tolkien's work tomorrow, you do not care how long it took him to write it all. You cares how good is this day. And that is what we try to think too. And I feel like if it is good, if it is really good, everything else falls into place and takes care of itself.
And although sometimes to push back. Sorry to interrupt this. I have done it to you a thousand times. So you. Get me back, please. Sometimes the deadline, you know, some of the greatest, like movies and books have been, you think about like just to forget which one notes from underground or something. He needed the money, so he had to write it real quick. Sometimes the deadline creates.
As powerful at taking a creative mind of an artist and just like slapping it around to force some of the good stuff out.
Now, the problem with history, of course, is there is there is different definitions of good that like it is not just about which you talk about, which is the storytelling, the richness of the storytelling.
And I am sure you are you know, again, not to compliment you too much, but you are one of the great storytellers of our time that that I am sure if you put in a jail cell and force a like somebody point a gun at you, you could tell one hell of a good story.
But you still need the facts of history, not necessarily the facts, but, you know, like making sure you painting the right full picture, not perfectly right. that is what I meant about the audience.
does not understand what a history. You can not just riff and be wrong. So.
So let me let me both both oppose what you just said and back up what you just said.
Excellent. So I have a book that I wrote. Right. And in a book, you have a hard deadline. Right. So Harper Collins had a hard deadline on that book.
So when I released it, I was mad because I would have worked on it a lot longer, which is my style. Right. Get it right. But we had a chapter in that book entitled Pandemic Prolog Questionmark. And it was the book about the part about the Black Death in the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff. And and I was just doing an interview with a Spanish journalist this morning who said, did you ever think how lucky you got on that, on that?
You know, and first of all, lucky on a pandemic, it did strike you. But had I had my druthers, I would have kept that book working in my study for months more and the pandemic would have happened. And that and that would have looked like a chapter I wrote after the fact. I had to rewrite the whole thing. It would have been. So that argues for for what you said at the same time. I would have spent months more working on it because to me, it did not look the way I wanted it to look yet, you know, can you drop a hint of the things you are keeping on the shelves for the Alexander the Great?
I have talked around the I talked to somebody and they said, do you know that the very first word in your very first podcast, in the title, the very first thing that anybody ever saw with hardcore history is the is the word Alexander because the shows and title Alexander versus Hitler. I have talked around the career. I have done show after I talked about his mother in one episode, I talked about the the the the funeral games after his death. I have talked around this.
I have specifically left this giant Alexandrian sized hole in the middle because we are going to do that show one day. And I am going to lovingly enjoy talking about this crazily interesting figure of Alexander the Great. So that is one of the ones that is on the back pocket list. And what we try to do is, is whenever this we are doing Second World War in Asia and the Pacific, now I am on part five. Whenever the heck we finish this, the tendency is to then pick a very different period because we have had it and the audience has had it.
So it is. So I will eventually get to the Alexander saga.
What about just one last kind of little part of this is what about the other half of that first 10 minute, 15 minute episode, which is so you have done quite a bit about the World War. you have done quite a bit about Germany. Will you ever think about doing Hitler and the man?
it is funny because I talked earlier about how I do not like to go back to the old shows because our standards have changed so much with a long time ago. One of my standards for not getting five hour podcasts done or not getting too deeply into them was to flit around the interesting points. We did not realize we were going to get an audience that wanted the actual history. We thought we could just go with assume the audience knew the details and just talk about the weird stuff that only makes up one part of the show now.
So we did a show called Nazi Tidbits, and it was just little things about, you know, it is totally out of date now. Like, you know, you can still buy them, but they are out of date where we dealt a little with it. You know, it would be interesting. But I will give you another example. I mean, history is not stagnant, as you know. And we had talked about Stalin earlier and ghosts of the OSS front was done years ago and people were writing me from Russia now and say, well, your portrayal of Stalin is totally out of out of it is outdated because there is all this new stuff from the former Soviet Union.
And you do you turn around, you go, OK, they are right. And so when you talk about Hitler, it is very interesting to think about how I would do a Hitler show today versus how I did one 10 years ago. And you would think, well, what is new? I mean, it happens a lot, but there is lots of new stuff and there is lots of new scholarship. And and so, yeah, I would think that would be an interesting one to do someday.
I have not thought about that.
that is not in the back pocket. But but yeah, that'll be interesting.
I have a disproportionate amount of power because a trapped somehow in the room and and thereby during a pandemic.
A pandemic. So like my hope will be stuck in your head. But after Alexander the Great, which would be an amazing podcast, I hope you do give a return to Hitler the rise and fall of the Third Reich, which to me, I read contemporary book basically.
Yeah. Yeah. And I exactly. Is by a person who was there. Shiru.
Yeah, I, I really loved that study of the men of Hitler and I would love to hear your study of certain aspects of it, perhaps even an episode that is like more focus on a very particular period. I just feel like you can tell a story that is funny, Hiller's one of the most studied people and I still feel like all the stories or most of the stories have been told.
And there is listen, I have got three books at home. I am on all the publisher's lists now.
And they just young Hitler. there is this Hitler. there is that. I mean, I have been reading these books and I have read about Hitler. I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. My mother thought I needed to go to a psychologist because I read it when I was six. And she said, there is something wrong with the boy.
And but she was right. But she was absolutely right. But but you would think that that something like that is pretty established fact. And yet there is new stuff coming out all the time. And needless to say, Germany's been investigating this guy forever and sometimes it takes years to get the translations. I took five years of German in school. I can not read any of it. So so I mean, and and he is when you talk about fascinating figures, he is so the whole thing is so twisted.
Weird. There was a it came out a couple of years ago. Somebody found a tape of him talking to General, I want to say was General the Finnish general Mannerheim. Right. And he is just in a very normal conversation of the sort we are having now. And, you know, the Hitler tapes, when you hear normalise ranting and raving. But this was a very sedate and I wish I had understood the German well enough to really get a feel because I was reading what German said and I said, wow, you can really hear the Southern accent, you know, little things that only a native speaker would hear.
And I remember thinking, this is such a different side of this twisted character. And you would think you would always you would think that this was information that was out in in the rise and fall of the writer, but it was not. And so this this this is a goes along with that stuff about new stuff coming out all the time.
Alexander new stuff coming out all the time really well, at least interpretations rather than factual data. And those color those give depth to your understanding.
Yes. And you want that because the historiography people people love that. And that was a byproduct of my lack of credentials where we thought we are going to bring in the historians and we call them audio footnotes right away for me to say, listen, I am not a historian, but I will quote this guy who is so you can trust him. But then we would quote other people who had different views and people did not realize that, you know, if they are not history majors, that historians do not always agree on this stuff and that they have disagreements and they loved that.
So so I love the fact that there is more stuff out there because it allows us to then bring in other points of view and sort of maybe three dimensional eyes or flesh out the story a little bit more.
To last question is one really simple, one absurdly ridiculous and perhaps also simple. First, who has been in a serial? I do not know what you are talking about. Very well, how is that for an answer? it is like asking me, is Harvey the white rabbit real, I do not know, there is carrots all around the production room, but I do not know what that means.
Well, a lot of people demanded that. I prove I somehow figure out a way to prove the existence. I said he was real. People would say, no, he is not. And if I said he was if he was not real, they would say, yes, he is. So it is a Santa Claus Easter Bunny kind of vibe there.
Yeah. I mean, what is real anyway?
that is exactly what I told him. It exists. OK, the most absurd question. I am very sorry. Very sad. But then again, I am not what what is the meaning of it all?
You study history. Of human history, have you been able to make sense of why the hell we are here on this spinning rock? What does any of it even make sense? what is the meaning of life? Hmmm, what I look at sometimes that I find interesting is certain consistencies that we have over time. History does not repeat, but it has a constant and the constant is us. Now we change. And I had mentioned earlier the the wickedly weird time we live in with what social media is doing to us as guinea pigs.
And that is a new element. But we are still people who are motivated by love, hate, greed, envy, sex. I mean, all these things that would have connected us with the ancients. Right. that is the part that always makes history sound like it rhymes, you know. And when you put the constant the human element and you mix it with systems that are similar. So one of the reasons that the ancient Roman Republic is something that people point to all the time as something that seems like we are repeating history is because you have the two, you have humans just like you had then, and you have a system that resembles the one we have here.
So you throw the constant in with a system that is somewhat similar and you begin to see things that look like they rhyme a little. So for me, I am always trying to figure out more about us. And when you show us in 500 years ago in Asia and 800 years ago in Africa, and you look at all these different places that you put the guinea pig in and you watch how the guinea pig responds to the different stimuli and challenges, I feel like it helps me.
Flush out a little bit more who we are in the long time line, not who we are today specifically, but who we have always been, it is a personal quest. it is not meant to educate anybody else. it is something that fascinates me.
Do you think there is in that common humanity throughout history of the guinea pig?
Is there a Y underneath it all or is it somehow like it feels like it is an experiment of some sort? I know you are into Elon Musk and I talked about this, the simulation thing, right, Nick Bostrom, sure. You had the idea that there is some some kid and we are the equivalent of an aliens ant farm, you know, and we hope he does not throw a tarantula in just to see what happens. I think the why is elude us, and I think that what makes philosophy and religion and those sorts of things so interesting is that they grapple with the why is.
But I am not wise enough to to propose a theory myself, but I am interested enough to read all the other ones out there. So let us put it this way. I do not think there is any definitive why that is been agreed upon, but the various theories are fascinating.
Yeah, whatever it is, whoever the kid is that created this thing, the the ant farm, kind of interesting. it is so far a little bit a little bit twisted and perverted and sadistic, maybe that is what makes it fun, I think. But then again, that is the Russian perspective.
I was just going to say it is the Russian perspective, a little bit of what makes the Russians so Russian history.
One day I will do some Russian history. I took it to college. Oh, that is the ant farm baby.
that is an ant farm with a very, very frustrated young teenage alien kid.
Then I can not say I have already complimented you way too much. I am a huge fan. This has been an incredible conversation. it is a huge gift. I you are your gift of humanity.
I hope you let me cut you off and just say you have done a wonderful job. This has been fun for me. The questions and more importantly, the questions can come from anybody. The counterstatements. Your responses have been wonderful. You made this a very fun intellectual discussion for me. Thank you. Or let me have the last word and say I agree with Elon. And despite the doom caster say that, I think we have concluded definitively and you do not get a chance to respond that love is, in fact the answer and the way forward.
So thanks so much, Dan.
