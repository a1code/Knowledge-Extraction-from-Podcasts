The following is a conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett, her second time on the podcast. she is a neuroscientist at Northeastern University and one of my favorite people. Her new book called Seven and a Half Lessons about the Brain is out now as of a couple of days ago. So you should definitely support Lisa by buying it and sharing with friends if you like it. it is a great short intro to The Human Brain. Quick mention of his sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode, I thought of Greens, the only one drink that I start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases, eat, sleep a mattress that calls itself and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep master class online courses that I enjoy from some of the most amazing people in history and better help online therapy with a licensed professional.
Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that Lisa, just like Benoit, Kelis is a local brilliant mind friend and someone I can see talking to many more times. Sometimes it is fun to talk to a scientist, but just about their field of expertise, but also about random topics, even silly ones from love to music to philosophy. Ultimately, it is about having fun, something I know nothing about.
This conversation is certainly that you may not always work, but it is worth a shot. I think it is valuable to alternate among all kinds of dimensions, like between deeper technical discussions and more fun. Random discussion from liberal thinker to conservative thinker, from musician to athey, from CEO to junior engineer, from friend to stranger. Variety makes life in conversation more interesting. let us see where this little podcast journey goes if you enjoy this thing. Subscribe on YouTube.

This show sponsored by Athletic Greens that all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. It replace the multivitamin for me and went far beyond that was seventy five vitamins and minerals.
I do intermittent fasting of 16 to 24 hours every day and always break my fast with of greens. I honestly can not say enough good things about these guys. It helps me not worry whether I am getting all the nutrients I need. One of the many reasons I am a fan is that they keep iterating on the formula. As an engineer, I love continuous improvement. Life is not about reaching perfection. it is about constantly striving for it and making sure each iteration is a positive delta.
The other thing I have taken for a long time outside of athletic greens is fish oil. Some especially excited now that they are selling fish oil and are offering listeners of this podcast free month's supply of wild caught omega three fish oil. When you go to a third of that council likes to claim the special offer so you can be lazy like me and get all your nutrients from the same company. Click the athletic dot com slash lacks link in the description to get the fish oil.
And the only one supplement I rely on for their nutritional foundation are my physical and mental performance. This show is also sponsored by Eat, Sleep, and it is part pro matches, it controls temperature with an app, is packed with sensors and can cool down to as low as 55 degrees on each side of the bed. Separately, it is been a game changer for me. I just enjoy sleep and power naps way more. Now I feel like I fall asleep faster and get more restful sleep.
Combination of cool bed and warm blanket is amazing. Now, if you love your current mattress but are still looking for temperature control, its leaves new pod cover as dynamic cooling and heating capabilities onto your current mattress. It can cool down to 55 degrees or like a very cold day in Boston, like today, heat up to one hundred and ten degrees and do so on each side of the bed separately. Also, you can track a bunch of metrics like heart rate variability, but honestly, cooling alone is worth the money.
Go to a city council that works, and when you buy stuff there during the holidays, you will get a special savings. As listeners of this podcast that is a dotcom slash likes. This show is also sponsored by Master Class one hundred eighty dollars a year for an all access pass to watch courses from literally the best people in the world and a bunch of different topics. Let me list some that I have really enjoyed watching Chris Hadfield on space exploration, Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking communication will right.

This show sponsored by Better Help spelled H-E LP Help. They figure out what you need, a match with a licensed professional therapist in order 48 hours, a chat with a person on there and enjoy it. Of course, I also have been talking to Mr. David Goggins over the past few months, who is definitely not a licensed professional therapist, but he does help me meet his and my demons and become comfortable to exist in their presence. Everyone is different, but for me, I think suffering is essential for creation.
But you can suffer beautifully in a way that does not destroy you. Therapy can help in whatever form that therapy takes, and so better help is an option worth trying. There is private, affordable, available, worldwide.
You can communicate by text any time, schedule weekly audio and video sessions.

Based on the comments in our previous conversation, I think a lot of people will be very disappointed, I should say, to learn that you are, in fact married, as they say, all the good ones are taken.
OK, so I am a fan of your husband as well, Dan. he is a programmer. Musician, so a man after my own heart. Can I ask a ridiculously overromanticized question of when did you first fall in love with Dan is actually it is a really it is a really romantic story.
I think. So I was divorced by the time I was twenty six. Twenty seven, twenty six I guess. And I was in my first academic job, which was Penn State University, which is in the middle of Pennsylvania, surrounded by mountains. So it is four hours to get anywhere to get to Philadelphia, New York, Washington. I mean, you are basically stuck, you know, um. And I was very fortunate to have a lot of other assistant professors who were hired at the same time as I was.
So there were a lot of us. We were all friends, which was really fun. But I was single and I did not want to date a student. And there were no and I was not going to date somebody in my department. that is just a recipe for disaster. Yeah.
So even at twenty, whatever you were, you are already wise enough to know that.
Yeah, a little bit maybe. Yeah. I would not call me wise at that age, but anyways, I am not sure that I would say that I am wise now, but um. And so, um, after you know, I was spending probably 16 hours a day in the lab because it was my first year and as an assistant professor and there is a lot to do.
And I was also bitching and moaning to my friends that I had not had sex and I do not know how many months. And it was I was starting to, you know, become unhappy with my life.
And I think at a certain point they just got tired of listening to me bitch and moan and said, just do something about it then like, you know, if you are unhappy.
And so the first thing I did was I made friends with a sushi chef in town.
And this is a state college, Pennsylvania in the early nineties was there was like a pizza shop and a sub shop and actually a very good bagel shop and one good coffee shop and maybe one nice restaurant. I mean, there was really but there was a the second son of a Japanese sushi chef who was not going to inherit the restaurant. And so he moved to Pennsylvania and was giving sushi lessons. So I met this guy, the sushi, the sushi chef, and we decided to throw a sushi party at the coffee shop.
So we basically it was the goal was to invite every eligible bachelor really within like a 20 mile radius. We had a totally fun time. I wore an awesome crushed velvet burgundy dress with beautiful dress. And I did not meet any I met a lot of front new friends, but I did not meet anybody. So then I thought, OK, well, maybe I will try the personals ads, which I had never used before in my life.
And, um, I first tried the paper personals ads like a newspaper, like in the newspaper that did not work. And then a friend of mine said, oh, you know, there is this thing called net news. So we are going this is like nineteen ninety two maybe. So there was this anonymous. You could do it anonymously. So you would you would read, you could post or you could read ads and then respond to an address which was anonymous and that was yoked to somebody's real address and.
And there was always a lag because it was this like a bulletin board sort of thing.
So at first I read I read them over and I decided to to respond to one or two.
And, you know, it was interesting to say this is not on the Internet. Yeah, this is totally on the Internet. But it takes there is a delay of a couple of days or whatever. Yeah. Right. Right.
it is 1992 and there is no web web pictures. there is no pictures. The web does not exist.
it is all done in ASCII format, sort of. And you know, but the real ASCII.
But the ratio of men to women was like ten to one. I mean, there were many more men because it was basically academics and the government. That was it. that is no, I mean, I think AOL maybe was just starting to become popular, but. And so the first person I met told me that he was a he worked he was a scientist who worked for NASA and. Yeah. Anyways, it turned out that he did not actually make this holiday brag.
As you elevate your as opposed to saying you are taller than you are, you say like your position.
Yeah. And I actually I would have been fine dating somebody who was a scientist.
it is just that they have it is just that whoever I date has to just accept that I am and that I am I was pretty ambitious and was trying to make my career. And, you know, that is not that that is not I think it is maybe more common now for men to maybe accept that in their female partners.
But at that time, not not so intimidating, I guess.
Yes, I that has been said. And so and so then the next one I actually corresponded with and we actually got to the point of talking on the phone and we had this really kind of funny conversation where, you know, we are chatting. And he said he is he introduces the idea that, you know, he is really looking for a dominant woman. And I am thinking I am a psychologist by training.
So I am thinking, oh, he means sex roles. Like, I am like, no, I am very assertive. And I am glad you think that. Anyways, long story short, that is not really what he meant.
Oh, OK.
I got it. Yeah. So I do you know, that will just show you my level of naiveté.
Like I was like I did not completely understand.
I was like, well yeah, you know, no.
At one point he asked me how I felt about him wearing my lingerie. And I was like, I do not even share my lingerie with my sister. Like, I do not share my laundry with anybody, you know? No.
The third one I interacted with was a banker who lived in Singapore and. That that conversation did not last very long because he made an announcement, I guess he he made an analogy between me and a. Character in The Fountainhead. The woman who is who is raped in The Fountainhead and I was like, OK, that is not that is not a good that is not a good no, that is not a good one. Not making it not that scene.
So then I said, then I was like, OK, you know what? I am going to post my own ad. And so I did I post it. Well, first I wrote my ad and then I of course, I checked it with my my friends who were also assistant professors that are like my little Greek chorus. And then I posted it and I got something like, I do not know, 80 something responses in twenty four hours.
I mean, it was do you remember the pitch like how you, I guess, condensed yourself?
I do not remember it exactly, although Dand has it.
But actually for our 20th wedding anniversary he took our our exchanges and he printed them off and put them in a leather bound book for us to read, which was really sweet.
Yeah, I think I was just really direct. Like, I am almost 30. I am a scientist. I am not looking, you know, I am looking for something serious and, you know, but the thing is, I forgot to say where my location was and my age.
Yeah. Which I forgot. Yeah.
So I got lots of I mean I will say so I printed off all of the responses and I had all my friends over and we were, you know, had a big I made a big pot of gumbo and we drank through several bottles of wine reading these responses.
And I would say for the most part they were really sweet, like earnest and genuine. As much as you could tell that somebody was being genuine, it seemed, you know, there were a couple of really funky ones like, you know, this one couple who told me that I was their soulmate, the two of them. And they were looking for, you know, a third person.
And I was like, OK, but mostly super seem like super genuine people. And so I chose five men to start corresponding with and I was corresponding with them.
And then about a week later, I get this other email and OK, and then I post something the next day that said, OK, you know, thank you so much and I am going to answer to every person back. But then after that I said, OK, I am not going to answer anymore, you know, because it was they were still coming in. I could not you know, I have a job and, you know, a house to take care of and stuff.
So, yeah.
And then about a week later, I get this other email and he says, you know, he just describes himself like, I am this, I am this, I am this. I am a chef. I am a scientist. Some of this, some of this. And so I emailed him back and I said, you know, you seem interesting. You can write me at my actual address if you want. here is my address. I am not really responding. I am not really responding to other people anymore.
But you seem interesting. You know, you can write to me if you want. And then he wrote to me and I then I wrote him back and I it was it was a nondescript kind of email. And I wrote him back and I said, thanks for responding. You know, I am really busy right now. I was in the middle of writing my first slate of grant applications, so I was really consumed and I said, I will get back to you in a couple of days.
And so I did. I waited a couple of days. I my grants were, you know, safe grant application safely out the door. And then I emailed them back. And then he emailed me and then really across two days, we sent 100 emails. And text only with their pictures and the text only, text only, and then so this was like a Thursday into Friday and then Friday he said, let us talk on the weekend on the phone.
And I said, OK. And he wanted to talk Sunday night. And I had a date Sunday night.
So I said, OK, sure, we can talk Sunday night.
And then I was like, well, you know, I do not really want to cancel my date, so I am just going to call him on Saturday. So I just called. I could call them on Saturday.
And a woman answered, Oh, wow. that is not cool, not cool. And so she says, you know, hello, and I say, oh, you know, is down there. And she said, Sure, can I ask who is calling? And I said it, tell them it is Lisa. And she went, Oh, my God, oh, my God.
I am just a friend. I am just a friend. I just want to tell you, I am just a friend.
And I was like, yeah, this is adorable, but she does not. And then he gets on the phone, not, hi, nice to me. The first thing he says to me, she is just a friend, so.
I was just so charmed, really, by the whole thing, so it was it was Yom Kippur, it was the Jewish day of Atonement that was ending, and they were baking cookies and going to breakfast. So people, you know, as you know, fast all day and then they go to a party and they breakfast. So I thought, OK, I will just I will just, you know, cancel my date. So I did. And I stayed home and we talked for eight hours.
And then the next night for six hours, and basically it just went on like that, and then by the end of the week he he flew to state college and, you know, we would gone through this whole thing where I would said, we are going to take it slow. we are going to get to know each other, you know, and then really by I think we talked like two or three times these like really long conversations. And then he said, I am just going to fly there.
And then so, of course, there is. I do not even know that there were fax machines at that point. I mean, maybe there were, but I do not think so anyway. So he we decide we will exchange pictures. And so he you know, I take my photograph and I give it to my secretary and I say to my secretary. This I think that setting this priority mail priority, and he goes, OK, I will send a priority, Madeleine, make this a priority like I know priority mail, OK?
And then so I get Dan's photograph in the mail and, you know, it is it is him in a in shorts. And you can see that he is probably somewhere like the Bahamas or something like that. And it is like cropped. So clearly what he is done is he is taken a photograph where, you know, he is been in it with someone else who turned out to be his ex-wife. So I am thinking, well, this is awesome. You know, I have hit the jackpot.
he is he is, you know, very appealing to me, very attractive. And and then, you know, my photograph does not show up and it does not show up. And, you know, so like, one day and then two days and then, you know, he is he is like, you know, I said, well, I asked my secretary to send a priority. I mean, I do not know, you know, what he did. And and he is like I said, I am like, well, you do not have to, you know, you do not have to come.
And he is like, no, no, no.
I am going to I am going to you know, we have had like five dates, the equivalent of five dates practically. And then so he is supposed to fly on a Thursday or Friday. I can not remember. And I get a call like maybe an hour before his flight supposed to leave and he says hi. And I say, and it is just something in his voice. Right. And I say, because at this point, I think I have talked to him like for twenty five hours, I do not know.
And he says, hi. And I am like, you got the picture. And he is like, yeah. And I am like, you do not like it. And he is like, well.
I am sure it is not. I am sure it is you are I am sure just not, you know, it is just probably not your best. Oh, no.
You know, if you do not, you do not have to come. And he is like, no, no, no, I am coming. And I am like, no, you do not have to come. And he is like, no, no. I really want to I am you know, I am getting on the plane. I am like, you do not have to get on the plane. he is like, No, I am getting on the plane. And so I go down to my I go, I am in my office.
This is happening. Right? So I go downstairs to my one of my closest friends who still actually one of my closest friends, who is one of my colleagues, and Kevin and I say Kevin and I go to Kevin, actually, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, he does not like to photograph.
And Kevin's like, well, which photograph did you send? And I am like, well, you know, the one where we are shooting pool. And he is like. Huh? You sent that photograph. that is a horrible photograph. I am like, yeah, but it is the only one that I had that was like where my hair was kind of similar to what it is now. And he is like, Lisa, do I have to check everything for you? You know, like you you should not have sent that, you know, but still he flew over.
So he flew from by the way he was in and he was in graduate school at Amherst at UMass Amherst. So he flew and I picked him up and. At the airport, and he was happy, so whatever the concern was, was gone. Yeah, and I was dressed, you know, carefully, carefully dressed me nervous.
I was really, really nervous because I I am not I do not really believe in fate and I do not really think there is only one person that you can be with, but I think.
You know, people who some people are curvy, they are kind of complicated, and so the number of people who fit them is maybe less than I like it, mathematically speaking.
And so when I was going to pick him up at the airport, I was thinking, well, this could I could be going to pick up the the person I am going to marry. Or not, I mean, like I really but I really, you know, like, our conversations were just very authentic and very moving and and we really connected and and I really felt like he understood me actually, um, in in a way that a lot of people do not.
And, um, and and what was really nice was at the time, you know, the airport was this tiny little airport out in a cornfield, basically. And so driving back to the town, we were in the car for 15 minutes, completely in the dark as I was driving. And so it was very similar to we had just spent, you know, twenty something hours on the telephone, sitting in the dark talking to each other.
So it was very familiar. And we basically spent the whole weekend together. And you met all my friends and we had a big party. And, um, and at the end of the weekend, I said, OK, you know, if we are going to give this a shot, we we probably can not we should not see other people. So it is a risk, you know, commitment.
But but I just did not see how it would work if we were dating people locally and then also seeing each other at a distance because, you know, I have had long distance relationships before and they are hard and they they take a lot of they take a lot of effort.
And so we decided we would give it three months and see what happened. And that was it.
Such an interesting thing like, well, what is that?
there is several billion of us and we are kind of roaming this world and then you kind of stick together. If I can find somebody that just like gets you and it is interesting to think about, there is probably thousands, if not millions of people that would would be sticky to depending on the curvature of your space. But. What what is the because you speak to the stickiness, like to the just the falling in love, like seeing that somebody really gets you maybe by way of telling.
Do you think do you remember there was a moment when you just realized, dammit, I think I am like, I think that is this is the guy I think I am in love.
We were having these conversations actually from the really from the second weekend we were together. So he flew back the next weekend to State College because my birthday was my 30th birthday. My friends were throwing me a party and we went hiking and we hiked up some mountain and we were sitting on a cliff over this, you know, overlook and talking to each other. And I was thinking and I actually said to him, like, I I have not really known you very long, but I feel like I am falling in love with you, which can not possibly be happening.
I must be projecto.
But it certainly feels that way, right. Like I do not believe in love at first sight. So this can not really be happening. But it sort of feels like it is. And he was like, I know what you mean. And so for the first three months or four months, we would say things to each other, like, I feel like I am in love with you, but. You know, but that can not. But things do not really work like that, so but, you know, so and then it became a joke like I feel like I am in love with you.
And then eventually, you know, I think but I think that was one moment where we were we were talking about just.
You know, not just all the great aspirations you have or all the things, but also things you do not like about yourself, things that you are worried about, things that you are scared of. And then I think the. That was sort of solidified the relationship and then there was one weekend where we went to Maine in the winter, which I love.
I mean, I really love the beach always, but in the winter, particularly because it is just beautiful home and whatever. Yeah.
And I also, I, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes, like, so there is this grand majestic scene of this very powerful ocean and it is all these beautiful blue grays and it is just it is just stunning. And so we were sitting on this huge rock in Maine and where we had gone for the weekend, it was freezing cold. And I honestly can not remember what he said or what I said or what. But I, I definitely remember having this feeling of I absolutely want to stay with this person like I and I do not know what my life will be like if I am not with this person like I need to be with this person.
Can we from a scientific and a human perspective dig into your belief? The first love at first sight is not is not possible. You do not believe in it because there is you do not think there is like a magic where you see somebody in the Jack Kerouac way and you are like, wow, that is something that is that is a special little.
Oh, I definitely think oh, I definitely think you can connect with someone instantly in an instance. And I definitely think you can say, oh, there is something there, and I am really clicking with that person romantically, but also just as friends, it is possible to do that. You recognize a mind that is like yours or that is compatible with yours. There are ways that you feel like you are being understood or that you understand something about this person, or maybe you see something in this person that you find really compelling or intriguing.
But I think, you know, your brain is predictive. Oregon, right? you are using your past. you are projecting, you are using your past to make predictions.
And I mean, not deliberately. that is how your brain is wired. that is what it does.
And so it is filling in all of the gaps that you. You know, there are lots of gaps of information that you do not, you know, information you do not have, and so your brain is filling those in and, um, but it is not what love is.
No, I do not think so, actually. I mean, to some extent, sure. You always you know, there is research to show that people who are in love always see the best in each other. And they you know, when there is a when there is a negative interpretation or positive interpretation, you know, they choose the positive ones. there is a little bit of positive illusion they are going on. that is what the research shows.
But I think. I think that when you find somebody who not just appreciates. Your faults, but loves you for them, actually, you know, like maybe even does not see them as a Faulds, that is.
You so you have to be honest enough about what your what your faults are, so it is easy to love someone for all the things that they.
For all the wonderful characteristics they have, it is harder, I think, to love someone despite their faults or maybe even the faults that they see are not really faults at all to you. they are actually something really special.
But is not that can you explain that by saying the brain kind of like you are projecting your you have a conception of a human being or just a spirit that really connects with you and you are projecting that onto that person.
And yes, just within that framework, all their faults then become beautiful, like a little maybe.
But you just have to pay attention to the prediction error. No, but maybe that is what love like maybe you start ignoring the prediction areas, maybe love is just your ability, like to ignore the prediction error?
Well, I think that there is some research that might say that, but that is not my experience, I guess. But there is some research that says I mean, there is some research that says you have to have an optimal margin of illusion, which means that you that you put a positive spin on on smaller things, but you do not ignore the bigger things. Right. And I think without being judgmental at all, when someone says to me, you know, you are not who I thought you were.
I mean, nobody says I said that to me in a really long time. But certainly when I was younger, that was you know, you are not who I thought you were. My reaction to that was, well, whose fault is that? You know?
Yeah, um, I am a pretty I am a pretty upfront person. Um, I mean, I will, though, say that in my experience, people people do not lie to you about who they are. They lie to themselves in your presence. Yeah, and so, you know, you do not want to get tied, tied up in that, tangled up in that, and I think from the get go, Dan and I were just for whatever reason, maybe it is because we both have been divorced already and, you know.
You know, he told me who we thought he was and he was pretty accurate as far as I can, pretty much actually.
I mean, I there is very I can not say that I have ever come across a characteristic in him that really surprised me in a bad way.
it is hard to know yourself. It is hard, you know, to communicate that for sure.
I mean, I will say, you know, I had the advantage of training as a therapist, which meant for five years I was under a fucking microscope. Yeah. You know, when I was training as a therapist, it was our four hour supervision, which meant if you were in a room with a client for an hour, you had an hour with a with a supervisor. So that supervisor was behind the mirror for your session. And then you went and had an hour of discussion about what you said, what you did not say, learning to use your own react your own feelings and thoughts as a tool to probe the mind of the client and so on.
And so you can not help but learn. A lot of you can not help but learn a lot about yourself in that process.
Do you think knowing or learning how the sausage is made ruins the magic of the actual experience, like using neuroscientist who studies the brain? Do you think it ruins the magic of, like, love at first sight? Or are you do you consciously are still able to lose yourself in the moment?
I am definitely able to lose myself in the moment. Is why involved?
Not always chocolate. I mean, I am kind of mind altering substance, right. But yeah.
Yeah, for sure. I mean, I guess what I would say, though, is that. For me, part of the magic is the process like so, uh, you know, so so I remember there was well, I was working on this on this on this book of essays. I was in New York. I can not remember why I was in New York, but I was in New York for something and I was in Central Park and I was looking at all the people with their babies.
And I was thinking. Every effort that each one of these are so tiny little brain that is wiring itself right now, and I and I, I just I felt in that moment I was like, I am never going to look at an infant in the same way ever again. And so to me, I mean, honestly, before I started learning about brain development, I thought babies were cute, but not that interesting until they could do interact with you and do things.
Of course, my own infant, I thought was extraordinarily interesting.
But, you know, they are kind of like lumps. that is, you know, until they can, you know, interact with you. But they are anything but lumps. I mean, like, you know, so and part of the.
I mean, all I can say is I have deep affection now for, like tiny little babies in a way that I did not really before because of the I am just so curious about the actual process, the mechanisms of the wiring of the brain, the learning, all the magic of the neurobiology.
Yeah.
And or, you know, something like, you know, when you make eye contact with someone directly, sometimes, you know, you you feel something, right? Yeah. And that is weird.
What is it and what is that. And so so to me that is not that is not backing away from the moment. that is like expanding the moment. it is like that is incredibly cool. You know, when I was I will just say that when I was when I was in graduate school, I also. Was in therapy because it is almost a given that you are going to be in therapy yourself if you are going to become a therapist and I had a deal, you know, with my therapist, which was that I could call time out at any moment that I wanted to as long as I was being responsible about it.
And I was not using it as a way to get out of something. And he could tell me, no, you know, he could decline and say, no, you are you know, you are using this to get out of something. But I could call time out whenever I want and say, what are you doing right now? Like, what do you here is what I am experiencing. What are you trying to do? Like, I wanted to use my own experience to interrogate what the process was and that made it.
More helpful in a way. Do you know what I mean? So, yeah, I do not I do not think learning how something works makes it less magical, actually, but that is just me, I guess.
I do not know. Would you?
Yes. I tend to have two modes, one is one is an engineer and one is romantic, and I am conscious of like like the girl, like you like there is two rooms you can go into, the one, the engineer room.
And I think that ruins the romance. So I tend to there is two rooms. One is the engineering room, I think from first principles. How do we build the thing that creates this kind of behavior? And then you go into the romantic room where you are like emotional. it is a roller coaster. And then you are the thing is, let us take it slow and then you get married the next night. You just this giant mess and you write a song and then you cry and then you send a bunch of text and anger and and whatever.
And somehow you are in Vegas and there is random people and you are drunk and whatever, all that like in poetry and just mess of it. Fighting. Yeah. that is not those are two rooms and you go back between between them. But I think the way you put it is quite poetic.
I think you are much, you are much better that adult thing now with love than, than perhaps I am because there is a magic to children.
I also think. Like of adults as children, it is kind of cool to see it is a cool thought experiment to look at adults and think like they used to be a baby and then that is like a fully wired baby and it is just walking around pretending to be like all serious and important, wearing a suit or something.
But they used to be a baby. And then you think of like the parenting and all the experiences they had, like, it is cool to think of it that way, but then I start thinking, like from a machine learning perspective. But once you are like the romantic moments, all that kind of stuff, all that falls away, I forget about all that. I do not know what is the one thing.
Maybe, maybe. But I also think it might be an age thing or maybe an experience thing. So I think. We all I mean, if you are exposed to Western culture at all, you are exposed to the sort of idealized stereotypic, romantic, romantic, you know, exchange and what does it mean to be romantic? And so here is a test.
I do not see how to phrase it. OK, so not really test, but this this tells you something about your own ideas about romance. For Valentine's Day one year, my husband bought me a six way plug. Is that romantic or not romantic? Like, so secret plays that is second out like a yeah, like to put in an outlet. Is that romantic or not romantic? I mean, depends the look in his eyes when he does it, I mean, it depends on.
The conversation that led up to that point depends how much. it is like the music, because you have a very you are both from the my experiences with you as a fan, you have both the romantic and we have a very pragmatic like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness and there is something about a six way plug that cuts the bullshit that connects to the human.
Like he understands who you are. Exactly.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That was the most romantic if he could have given me because he knows me so well, he has a deep understanding of me, which is that I will sit and suffer and complain about the fact that I have to plug and unplug things and I will bitch and moan until the cows come home.
But it would never occur to me to go buy a bloody six way plug, whereas for him he bought it.
He plugged it in, he arranged, he taped up all my wires.
He made it like really usable. And for me that was that was the best.
It was a bad thing because he understood who I was and he did something very or, you know, just the casual like we moved into a house that went we went from having a two car garage to a one car garage. And I said, OK, you know, I am from Canada. I am not bothered by snow. Well, I mean, I am a little bothered by snow, but he is very bothered by snow. So I am like, OK, you can park your car in the garage.
it is fine. Every day when it snows, he goes out and cleans my car. Every day. Like, I never asked him to do it. He just does it because he knows that I am cutting it really close in the morning. You know, when we when we all used to go to work, I have it timed to the second so that I can get up as late as possible, work out as long as possible, you know, just and make it into my office like a minute before my first meeting.
And so if it snows unexpectedly or something, I am screwed because now that is an added an added 10 or 15 minutes and I am going to be late anyways. You know, it is just these little tiny things that he is he is he is he is a really easygoing guy. And he does not look like somebody who pays attention to detail.
He does not fuss about detail, but he definitely pays attention to detail. And it is it is very, very romantic in the sense that he. You know, he loves me despite my little details and understands you. Yeah, it is kind of hilarious that that is the six we plug is the the most fulfilling, richest display of romance in your life. I love it. I love the performance.
Romance is really it is not all about chocolates and flowers and, you know, whatever. I mean, those are all nice, too. But sometimes it is about the sex, sometimes it is about the sex.
So maybe one way I could ask before we talk about the details, you also have the author of another book as we talked about how emotions are made. So it is interesting to talk about the process of writing. You mentioned you were in New York. What have you learned from writing these two books about the actual process of writing? And maybe I do not know what is the most interesting thing to talk about there? Maybe the biggest challenges or the boring, mundane, systematic like day to day of what worked for you, like sex or or even just about the neuroscience that you have learned through the process of trying to write them.
here is the thing I learned.
If you think that it is going to take you a year to write your book, it is going to take you three years to write your book.
that is the first thing I learned is that no matter how organized you are, it is always going to take way longer than what you think.
Um, in part because, um, very few people make an outline and then just stick to it. You know, the the some of the topics really take on a life of their own. And to some extent you want to let them. You want to let them have their voice, you know, you want to follow leads until you feel satisfied that you have dealt with the topic appropriately, but I and that part is actually fun.
it is not fun to feel like you are constantly behind the eight ball in terms of time here, but it is the exploration and the foraging for information is incredibly fun for me. Anyways, I found it really enjoyable. And if I was not also running a lab at the same time and trying to keep my family going, you know, it would have been the whole thing would have just been fun. But I would say the hardest thing about the most important thing I think I learned is also the hardest thing.
And that for me, which is knowing what to leave out, a really good storyteller knows what to leave out in in academic writing. You you should not leave anything out. You all the details should be there. Right. And. And I you know, I have written or participated in in writing. Over 200 papers, peer reviewed papers, so I am pretty good with detail, knowing what to leave out, knowing what to leave out and not harming the validity of the story, that is a tricky, tricky thing.
It was tricky when I wrote How Emotions are made, but that is a standard popular science book. So it is three hundred something pages and then it has like a thousand and notes. And then each of the notes is attached to a web note, which is also long. So I mean, you know, it is, um, and it is start and I mean the final draft, I wrote three drafts of that book actually and the final draft. And then I had to cut by a third.
I mean or I mean, I, you know, it was like one hundred and. Fifty thousand words or something, and I had to cut it down to like one hundred and ten, so, um, obviously I struggled with what to leave out. You know, brevity is not my strong suit. I am always telling people that it is a warning.
So that is why this book was I you know, I would always been really fascinated with essays. I love reading essays. And after reading a small set of essays by Anne Fadiman called At Large and at Small, which I just loved these little essays.
What was the topic of those assets? They are they are called familiar essays. So the topics are like everyday topics like mail, um, coffee, chocolate.
I mean, just like and what she does is she weaves her own experience. it is a little bit like these conversations that you are so good at curating, actually, um, you are weaving together history and philosophy and science and also personal reflections and a little bit you feel like you are like. Eavesdropping on someone's train of thought, in a way, it is really the really compelling to me and even if it is just a mundane topic.
Yeah, but it is so interesting to learn about, like, all of these little stories in the. In the wrapping of the history of like mail, like that is that is really interesting and so I read these essays and then I wrote to her a little fan girl email. This was many years ago.
And and I said, I, I, I just love you. I love this book. And how did you learn to write essays like this? And she gave me a reading list of essays that I should read like writers. And so I read them all.
And anyway, so I decided it would be a really good challenge for me to try to write something really brief where I could.
Focus on know one or two really fascinating tidbits of of neuroscience, connect it to connect each one to something philosophical or, you know, just a question about human nature, do it in a really brief format without violating the validity of the science.
That was a I just sent myself this would I thought of as a really, really big challenge, in part because it was an incredibly hard thing for me to do in the first book.
Yeah, we should say that this is the seven and a half lessons, a very short book.
I mean, it is it is like it embodies brevity. The whole point throughout is just I mean, you could tell that there is editing like there is pain in trying to bring as brief as possible. As clean as possible. Yeah.
Yeah.
So it is either way I think of it is, you know, it is a little book of big science and big ideas, really big ideas and in brief little packages.
And, you know, I wrote it so that people could read it. I love reading on the beach. I love reading essays on the beach. I read it. I wrote it so people could read it on the beach or in the bathtub or a subway stop even if the beach is frozen over in the snow.
Yeah.
So my husband Dan calls it the first neuroscience beach read. that is his that is his phrasing. Yeah.
And like like you said, you learn a lot about writing from your husband, like you were saying. Oh, fine.
Well, he is he is one of the two of us. He is the better writer. he is a masterful writer. Um, he he is also I mean, he you know, he is a PhD in computer science. he is he is a software engineer, but he is he is also really good at organization of knowledge. So he built for a company he used to work for. He built one of the first knowledge management systems. And he is he now works at Google, where he does engineering education like he is he understands how to tell a good story, a just, you know, about anything really.
Um, he is got impeccable timing. he is really funny. And luckily for me, he knows very little about psychology or neuroscience. Well, now he knows more, obviously.
But so, you know, he was really when how emotions were made. You know, he was really, really helpful to me because the first draft of every chapter was me talking to him about what I would talk out loud about what I wanted to say and the order in which I wanted to say it. And then I would write it.
And then he would read it and tell me all the bits that could be excised. Yeah, and sometimes we would, you know, I should say, I mean, we do not he and I do not really argue about much except directions in the car. Like where that is where.
that is if we are going to have an argument that is going to be where it is going to happen, where what is and what is the nature of the argument about directions exactly.
I do not really know. it is just that we are very I think it is that spatially, you know, he he I use egocentric space. So I want to say, you know, turn left like I was. I am reasoning in relation to, like, my own physical, corporeal body. So, you know, you walk to the church and you turn left and you then, you know, whatever, you know, I am always like and his you know, he gives directions along centrally, which means organize around north, south, east, west.
So to you, the the earth is at the center of the solar system. And to him, no, I am reasonably I am at this. you are the center of the solar system.
OK, so anyway, so we but but here we you know, we, we had some really rip-roaring arguments like really rip-roaring arguments where he would say like who is this for, is this for the one percent.
And I would be like one percent meaning not you know, not wealth but like civilians versus academics, you know. So are these for the scientists or for this is this for the civilians? So he speaks for the for the people, for the city, for the people.
And I would be like, oh, you have to.
And so he made, you know, after one terrible argument that we had where it was really starting to affect our our relationship because we were so mad at each other all the time.
He made these little signs, writing and science, and we only use them. This this was like. When you when you pulled out a sign, that is it, like the other person just wins and you have to stop fighting about it. Yeah, and that is it. And so we just did that and we did not really have to use it too much for this book because this book was in some ways, you know, I did not have to learn a lot of new things for this book.
I had to learn some. But I a lot of. What I learned for seven and for how emotions are made really stood me in good stead for for this book. So there was a little bit each essay was a little bit of learning. A couple were was a little more than than a small amount.
But, um, but I did not have so much trouble here. Um, I had a lot of trouble with the first book, but still even here, you know, you know, he would tell me that I could take something out and I really wanted to keep it. And I think we only use the signs once.
Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book, I would love that the. Can we talk about. So one of the essays looks at our evolution. And let me ask the big question, did the human brain evolved to think that is essentially the question that you address in the essay?
Can you speak to. Sure. You know, the big caveat here is that we do not really know why brains evolved. The big why questions are called teleological questions.
And in general, scientists should avoid those questions because we do not know really what we do not know the why.
However, for for a very long time, the assumption was that evolution worked in a progressive upward scale, that you start off with simple organisms and those organisms get more complex and more complex and more complex. Now, obviously, that is true in some like really general way. Right. That that life started off as single celled organisms and things got more complex. But the idea that that brains evolved in some upward trajectory from simple brains in simple animals to complex brains in complex animals is called a phylogenetic scale.
And that phylogenetic scale is embedded in a lot of evolutionary thinking, including Darwin's actually, um, and it is been seriously challenged, I would say, by modern evolutionary biology.
And so, you know, thinking is something that rationality is something that humans, at least in the West, really prize as a great human achievement.
And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story is that know brains evolved in like sedimentary rock with a layer for instinct's, that is your lizard brain and layer on top of that for emotions. that is your limbic system, limbic meaning border. So it borders the parts that are for instincts. Oh, interesting.
And and then the neocortex or new cortex where rationality is supposed to live. that is the sort of traditional story you just keeps getting layered on top.
Right. By evolution. Right. And so you can think about, you know, I mean, sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it. The way I sometimes like to think about it is, you know, thinking about the cerebral cortex, like icing on an already baked cake, you know, where, you know, the cake is your inner beast.
These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions that have to be contained and that by the cortex and the it is just it is a fiction. it is a myth. it is a myth that you can trace all the way back to stories about morality in ancient Greece. But what you can do is look at the scientific record and say, well, there there is others.
There are other stories that you could tell about brain evolution and and the the context in which brains evolved. So when you look at creatures who do not have brains and you look at creatures who do. what is the difference? And you can look at, you know, some animals, so we call scientists call an environment that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche. What are the things what are the parts of the environment that matter to that animal?
And so there are some animals whose niche has not changed in 400 million years. So they are they are not these creatures are modern creatures, but they are living in a niche that has not changed much. And so their biology has not changed much. And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes that lurk deep, you know, in the molecular structure of cells.
And so you can by looking at various animals in their developmental state, meaning not you do not look at adult animals, you look at embryos of animals and developing animals.
You can see you can piece together a different story.
And that story is that brains evolved under the selection pressure of hunting, that in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene where animals deliberately ate one another. And what so, you know, before the Cambrian period, the animals did not really have well, they did not have brains, but they also did not have senses, really the very, very rudimentary senses. So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons is called an axis or a landslide.
And little anaphylaxis has no eyes. It has no ears. It has no nose. It it it has no eyes. It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark for circadian rhythm purposes. So and it it, it can not hear it has a vestibular cell to keep its body upright. It has a very rudimentary sense of touch and it does not really have any internal organs other than this like basically stomach. it is like a just like a it does not it does not have an enteric nervous system.
It does not have like a gut that, you know, moves like we do. It just has basically a tube.
Yeah. So it is like a container. Like a little container. Yeah. And so and really it does not it does not move very much. It can move, it just sort of wriggles it does not have very sophisticated movement and it is this really sweet little animal.
It sort of wriggles its way to a spot and then plants itself in the sand and just filters food as the food goes by.
And then when the food concentration decreases, it it just it just ejects itself, wriggles to the some spot randomly where probabilistically there will be more food and plants itself again.
So it is it is not it is not really aware, very aware that it has an environment, it has a niche, but that niche is very small and it is not really experiencing that niche very much. So it is it is basically like a little stomach on a stick. that is, that is really what it is. And um, but but when animals start to literally hunt each other. All of a sudden, it becomes important to have to be able to sense your environment because you need to know, is that blob up ahead going to eat me or should I eat it?
And so all of a sudden you want distant senses are very useful. And so in the water, distant senses are vision and a little bit hearing olfaction, smelling and touch because in the water touches a distant sense because you can feel the vibration.
So it is so close in on air, on land know vision is a distant sense. Touch not so much, but for elephants maybe.
Right. The vibrations, vibrations, olfaction, definitely because of the concentration of, you know, the more concentrated something is, the more likely it is to be close to you.
So animals developed senses, they developed ahead like a literal head. So Anthrax's does not even have a head, really.
it is just a what is the purpose of a head? that is a great question. Is it to have a job?
that is a great question. So, Jordt. So, yes, Jaws are a major useful feature.
Yeah, obviously they are a major adaptation after there is a split between vertebrates and invertebrates. So Antioch's this is thought to be very, very similar to the animal that before that split.
But then after the development, very quickly, after the development of ahead is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing. And and what goes along with that is the development of a brain.
it is where is that just a coincidence that the thing the part of our body, of the mammal, I think body that we eat with and like attack others with is also the thing that contains the all the majority of the brain type of.
Well, actually, the brain goes with the development of a head and the development of of a visual system and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on. So your senses are developing. And, um, and the other thing that is happening, right. Is that animals are getting bigger. Yeah. Because their and also their niche is getting bigger. Well, this is the culture.
Sorry to take a tiny tangent on. The new thing is it seems like the niche is getting bigger, but not just bigger, like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways, like predation seems to create like like the whole world becomes your oyster, whatever. But like you also start to carve out, like, the places in which you can operate the best.
Yeah. And in fact, that is absolutely right. And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind, your ability to make inferences about the inner life of of other creatures actually developed under the selection pressure of predation. Because it makes you a better predator. Do you ever look at you just said you looked at babies as these wiring creatures, do you ever think of humans as just clever predators like that? There is under underneath it all is this.
The nation will to power in all of its forms. Or are we now friendlier?
Yeah, so it is interesting. I mean, there there are there are zeitgeist and how humans think about themselves. Right. And so if you look in the 20th century. You can see that the idea of an inner beast that we are just predators, we are just basically animals, baseless animals, violent animals that have to be contained by culture and by our prodigious neocortex, um, really took hold, particularly after World War One and really held sway for much of that century.
And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say, you know what? we are talking mainly about Western Western scientific writing, Western philosophical writing. And and then, you know, late 90s, maybe you start to see books and articles about our social nature, that we are social animals and we are social animals.
But what does that mean exactly? And, um, about it is just carving out different issues in the space of ideas.
It looks. I think so. I think so.
So, um. So. You know, do humans are can humans be violent? Yes. Can humans be really helpful?
Yes, actually, and humans are interesting creatures because, you know, other animals can also be helpful to one another. In fact, there is a whole literature, booming literature on how other animals are. You know, support one another, they regulate each other's nervous systems in interesting ways, and they will be helpful to one another, right. So, for example, there is a whole literature on rodents and how they they signal one another, what it is safe to eat, and they will perform acts of generosity to their con specifics that are related to them or or who they were raised with.
So if an animal was raised in a litter, that is that they were raised in, although not even at the same time, they will be more likely to help that animal. So there is always some kind of physical relationship between animals that predicts whether or not they will help one another for humans. Humans. You know, we have ways of categorizing who is in our who is in our group and who is not by non-physical ways, right. By even by just something abstract like an idea.
And we are much more likely to extend help to people in our own group, whatever that group may be at that moment. Whatever your whatever feature you are using to define who is in your group and who is not, we are more likely to help those people than even members of our own family at times.
So humans are much more flexible in their. In the way that they help one another, but also in the way that they harm one another, so I do not. I do not I do not think I subscribe to, um. You know, we are primarily this or we are primarily that, I do not think have humans have Essence's in that way, really. I apologize to take us in this direction for a brief moment, but I have been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently in terms of reading.
And is there something that you think about in terms of the nature of evil from a neuroscience perspective? Is there some lessons that are sort of. Hopefull. About human civilization. That we can find in our brain with regard to the Hitlers of the world. Do you think about the the nature of evil?
Yeah, I do. I do not know that what I have to say is so useful from a I do not know that I can say is a neuroscientist will hear or here is a study that, you know what, I so I sort of have to take off my lab coat.
Right. And now I am going to now conjecture as a human who just also who has opinions but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience. But I am not speaking as a neuroscientist when I say this, because I do not think neuroscientists know enough really to be able to say.
But I guess the kinds of things I think about are. What so I have always thought even before I knew anything about neuroscience, um, I have always thought that. I do not think anybody could become Hitler, but I think the majority of people can be. Can do are capable of doing very bad things. it is just the question is really how much encouragement does it take from the environment to get them to do something bad?
that is what I kind of when I look at the life of Hitler, it seems like there is so many places where something could have intervened and changed completely.
The person I mean, there is the caricature, like the obvious places where he was an artist. And if he was not rejected as an artist, he was a reasonably good artist. So that that could have changed. But just his entire life where he went in Vienna and all these kinds of things like the little InterAction's could have changed.
And there is probably millions of other people who are capable who the environment may be able to mold in the same way. Did this particular person to create this particular kind of charismatic leader in this particular moment of time?
Absolutely. And I guess the way I the way that I would say I, I would agree 100 percent. And I guess the way that I would say it is like this.
In the West, we have a way of reasoning about causation, which focuses on single simple causes for things, you know, there is a there is an essence to Hitler, there is an essence to his character. He was born with that essence or it was forged very, very early in his life. And that explains the, um, the landscape of his life, horrible landscape of his behavior.
But there is another way to think about it, a way that actually is much more consistent with what we know about biology, how biology works in the physical world, and that is that most things are complex, not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard, but complex as in complexity that is more than the sum of their parts and that most phenomena have many, many. Week, non-linear interacting causes and so little things that we might not even be aware of can shift someone's developmental trajectory from this to that, and that is enough to take it on a whole set of other paths that, you know that and that these things are happening all the time.
So it is not random and it is not really it is not deterministic in the sense that, like everything you do determines your outcome.
But it is a little more like, you know, you are nudging someone from one set of possibilities to another set of possibilities.
And I but I think the the thing is, the thing that I find optimistic is that the the other side of that coin is also true. Right, so look at all the people who risked their lives to help people they did not even know. I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie, and the thing that I came away with, but, you know, the thing I came away with was.
Look at how like generous people were in the old days, he is making there are a lot of people he makes fun of and that is fine. But think about like those two guys.
Those are the Trump supporter guy, the transporter guys, those guys, those those kindness in them.
Right.
They took a complete stranger in a pandemic. Yeah. Into their house.
Who does that like, that is a really nice thing, or there is one scene, I mean, I want to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but but there is you know, there is one scene where he goes in.
He dresses up as a Jew.
I laugh myself sick at that scene, seriously. But but he goes in and he and there are these two old Jewish ladies.
What a bunch of sweethearts. Oh, my gosh. Like, really? Yeah.
I mean, that was what I was struck by, actually. I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter. Right. I mean, she was really kind and.
Yeah, so that is really what I was more struck by, like, you know, sure, there are other people who, you know, who do do very bad things or say bad things or whatever.
But, you know, we are like there is one guy who is completely stoic, like the guy at the who is doing the like, you know, sending the message that, well, if it is facts or whatever, he is just completely stoic.
But he is doing his job, actually, you know, like, you can not you do not know what he was thinking inside his head. You do not know what he is feeling. But he was totally professional doing his job.
OK, so I guess I just I had a bit of a different view, I guess. And I so I also think that about people. I think everybody is capable of kindness and but but, you know, it is the question is how much does it take and what are the circumstances?
So for some people, it is going to take a lot. And for some people it only takes a little bit. But, you know, are we actually.
Cultivating an environment for the next generation that. Provides opportunities for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness or, you know, I am not I am not saying that is like a Pollyanna ish person, but, you know, I think there is a lot of room for competition and debate and and so on. But I do not see Hitler as an anomaly, and I never have. That was even before I learned anything about neuroscience. And now I would say, knowing what we know about developmental trajectories and life histories and how important that is, you know, knowing what we know about, um, that the whole question of, like, nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question, you know, we have the kind of nature that requires nurture.
We have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born with unfinished brains, where the brains, their brains are wired across a twenty five year period with wiring instructions from the world that is created for them.
And so I do not think Hitler is an anomaly. You know, even if it is even if it is less probable that that would happen, it is possible that it could happen again, and it is not it is not like, you know, he is a bad seed. I mean, that does not I just want to say, like, of course, he is completely 100 percent responsible for his actions and all the bad things that happened. So I am not in any way this is not me saying.
But the environment is also responsible in part for creating the evil in this world.
So like Hitler's and different versions of more subtle, more smaller scale versions of evil.
But I tend to believe that there is a much stronger uh, I do not like to talk about evolutionary advantages, but it seems like it makes sense for love to be a more powerful emergent phenomena of our collective intelligence versus hate and evil and destruction, because from a survival, from a niche perspective, it seems to be a. Like in my own life and my thinking about the intuition, about the way humans work together to solve problems, it seems that love is a very useful tool.
I definitely agree with you, but I think the caveat here is that, you know, humans, the research suggests that humans are. Capable of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity to people in their ingroup. And we are also tribal. Yeah, I mean, that is the that is the kitschy way to say it, where tribes were tribal. Yeah. So that is the kitschy way to say it would I would say is that. You know, there are a lot of features.
That you can use to describe yourself if you do not have one identity, you do not have one self, you have many selves, you have many identities. Sometimes you are a man, sometimes you are a scientist. Sometimes you are a you have a brother or a sister or brother. So sometimes you are a brother. You know, you you sometimes you are a friend because you are human.
So you can keep zooming out. Yes. Living organism on earth. Yes, exactly.
that is exactly that is exactly right. And so there are there are some people who there is research which suggests that there are some people who will tell you I think it is appropriate and better to help.
I should help my family more than I should help my neighbors and I should help my neighbors more than I should help the average stranger and I should help, you know, the average stranger in my country more than I should help somebody outside my country. And I should help humans more than I should help, you know, other animals. And I know there is a clear hierarchy of helping.
And there are other people who, you know, they are their niche is much more inclusive. Right. And that they are humans first.
Right. Or creatures of the earth first, let us say.
And I I do not think we know how flexible those attitudes are because I do not think the research really tells us that. But in any case, there are you know, and there are beliefs people also have beliefs about.
there is this really interesting research in really in anthropology that looks at. What are cultures particularly afraid of, like what the people in a particular culture are organizing their social systems to prevent certain types of problems, so what are the problems that they are worried about? And and so there are some cultures that are much more hierarchical and some cultures that are, you know, much more egalitarian. There are some cultures that, you know, in the debate of like getting along versus getting ahead.
There are some cultures that really prioritize the individual over the group, and there are other cultures that really prioritize the group over the individual. You know, it is not like one of these is right and one of these is wrong. it is that, you know, different combinations of these features are different solutions that humans have come up with for for living in groups, which is a major adaptive advantage of our species. Um, and it is not the case that one of these is better in one of these is worse.
Although as a person, of course, I have opinions about that. And as a person I can say I would very much prefer certain I have certain beliefs and I really want everyone in the world to live by those beliefs, you know, but as a scientist, I know that it is not really the case that for the species, any one of these is better than any other. There are different solutions that work differentially well, in particular. You know, ecological parts of the world, but for individual humans, there are definitely some systems that are better in some systems that are worse.
But when when anthropologists or when neuroscientists or biologists are talking, they are not usually talking about the lives of individual people. they are talking about, you know, the species.
what is better for the species, the survivability of the species and what is better for the survivability of the species is variation that we have lots of cultures with lots of different solutions, because if the environment were to change drastically.
Some some of those solutions will work better than others, and you can see that happening with covid versus some people might be more susceptible to this, this virus and others.
And some variation is very useful, say covid was much, much more destructive than it is. And like, I do not know, 20 percent of the population was died. You know, that is good to have variability because then at least some percent will survive. Yeah.
I mean, the you know, the way that I used to describe it was, you know, using, you know, those movies like The War of the Worlds or Pacific Rim, you know, where like aliens come down from outer space and they, you know, want to kill humans.
And so all the humans band together as a species like and they all like all the little squabbling from countries and whatever, all goes away. And everyone is just one big, you know, well. That, you know. That does not happen. I mean, because covid, you know, the via a virus like code, like covid-19 is like a creature from outer space and that is not what you see happening, what you do see happening.
It is true that some people I mean, we could use this as an example of essentialism also. So just to say like exposure to the virus does not mean that you will become infected with a disease. So, I mean, in controlled studies, one of which was actually a coronavirus, not covid. But this was these are studies from 10 or so years ago, you know, only somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of people were developed respiratory illness when a virus was placed in their nose.
Yeah. And so there is a dose question all those not in these studies, actually.
So in these studies, the dose was consistent across all people and everything.
You know, they were sequestered in hotel rooms and what they ate was, you know, measured out by scientists and so on. And so when you hold dose, I mean, the dose issue is a real issue in the real world. But in these studies that was controlled and only somewhere between 20 and depending on the study, between 20 and 40 percent of people became infected with a disease.
So exposure to a virus does not mean de facto that you will develop an illness, you will be a carrier and you will spread the virus to other people. But you yourself may not. Your immune system may be in a state that you can make enough antibodies to not not show symptoms, not develop symptoms. And so, of course, what this means is, again, is that, you know, like if I asked you, do you think, you know, a virus is the because of of of a common cold or, you know, most people if I ask this question, I can tell you I asked this question.
So do you think a virus is the because of a cold? Most people would say, yes, I think it is. And then I say, yeah, well, only 20 to 40 percent of people develop respiratory illness in exposure to a virus.
So clearly it is a necessary because, but it is not a sufficient because. And there are other causes. Again, so not simple single causes for things. Right. Multiple interacting influences. So it is true that individuals vary in their susceptibility to illness upon exposure, but different cultures have different sets of norms and practices that allow that will slow or or speed the spread.
And that is that is the point that I was actually trying to make here, that that. You know, when the environment changes, that is there is a mutation of a virus that is incredibly infectious, some cultures will succumb, people in some cultures will succumb faster because of the particular. Norms and practices that that they have developed in their culture versus other cultures. Now there could be some other. You know, thing that changes that. Where those other other cultures are, you know, would do better.
it is a very individualistic cultures like ours may do much better under other types of selection pressures, but for covid, for things like covid, you know, my colleague Michele Gelfond, her research shows that she she looks at like loose cultures and tight cultures or cultures that have very, very strict rules versus cultures that are much more individualistic and where personal freedoms are more valued. And she you know, her research suggests that for pandemic circumstances, tight cultures, actually, the people survive better.
she is still lingering a little bit longer.
We started this part of the conversation talking about, you know, that humans evolved to think that the human brain evolved to think, implying is there like a progress to the thing that is always improving?
that is right. We never. Yeah. And so the answer is no. But let me sort of push back. So your intuition is very strong here, not your intuition the way you describe this.
But is it possible there is a direction to this evolution? Like do you think of this evolution as having a direction? Like it is like walking along a certain path towards something. So, you know, what is it?
Uh, the Elon Musk said, like, the Earth got bombarded with photons and then all of a sudden, like a Tesla was launched into space or whatever rockets started, like, is there a sense in which even though in the like within the system, the evolution seems to be this massive variation, we kind of trying to find our niches and so on. But do you think there ultimately when you zoom out, there is a direction that strong that does tend towards greater.
Complexity and intelligence, no, so I mean, and I and again, what I would say is I am really I am really just echoing people who are much smarter than I am about this.
But see, you are saying smarter. I thought it does not there is not that I thought there is no smarter.
No, I did not say there is no smarter. I said there is no direction. OK, so I think the thing to say or what I understand to be the case is that there is variation, it is not unbounded variation. And there are selectors. There are there are there are pressures that will select. And so not anything is possible because we live on a planet that has certain physical realities to it. Right. And but those physical realities are what constrain. The possibilities, the physical realities of our genes and the physical realities of our corporeal bodies and the physical realities of, you know, the of life on this planet.
So what I would say is that there is no direction, but there is it is not infinite possibility because we live on a particular planet that has particular statistical regularities in it and some things will never happen.
And so all of those things are are interacting with us, with our genes and so on and our, you know, the physical nature of our bodies to make some things more possible and some things less possible. Look, I mean, humans have very complex brains, but birds have complex brains. And so do you know, so do octopuses have very complex brains. And all three sets of all three of those brains are are somewhat different from one another.
You know, bird birds. Some birds have very complex brains. Some even have rudimentary language. They have no cerebral cortex. I mean, they admittedly, they have this is now less than two. Right? They have to listen to or listen one. Let me think now. This is lesson one. They have they have the same neurons, the same neurons that that in a human become the cerebral cortex. Birds have those neurons. They just do not form themselves into a cerebral cortex.
I mean, crows, for example, are very sophisticated animals. They can do a lot of the things that humans can do. In fact, all of the things that humans do that are very special, that seem very special. there is at least one other animal on the planet that can do those things to. what is special about the human brain is that we put them all together. So we learn from one another, we do not have to experience everything ourselves, we can watch another animal or another human experience something, and we can learn from that.
Well, there are many other animals who can learn by copying. Yeah. That we communicate with each other very, very efficiently. We have language, but we are not the only animals who are efficiently efficient communicators. There are lots of other animals who can efficiently communicate like bees, for example. You know, we cooperate really well with one another to do grand things. But there are other animals that cooperate too. And so every innovation that we have, other animals have to.
What we have is we have all of those together interwoven in this very complex dance in a brain that is not unique. Exactly. But that is, you know, it does have some features that make it useful, that make it particularly useful for us to do all of these things, you know, to have all of these things intertwined. So, you know, our brains are actually the last time we talked, I, I made a mistake because I said in my enthusiasm, I said, you know, our brains are are not larger, are relative to our bodies.
Our brains are not larger than than other primates. And that is actually not true. Actually, our our brains relative to our body size is somewhat larger. So an ape who is not a human, that is not a human. Their brains are larger than their body sizes than, say, relative to like a smaller monkey in a human's brain is larger relative to its body size than then.
that is a good approximation of your of whatever of of the bunch of stuff that you can shove in there.
But well, what I was going to say is. But our cerebral cortex is not larger than what you would expect for a brain of our of of of of its size.
So so relative to, say, an ape like a like a gorilla or a chimp or even a mammal like a dolphin or an elephant, you know, our brains are our cerebral cortex is as large as you would expect it to be for a brain of our size.
So there is nothing special about our cerebral cortex.
And this is something I explain in the book where I say, OK, you know, like by analogy, if you walk into somebody's house and you see that they have a huge kitchen, you know, you might think, well, maybe maybe this is a place I really definitely want to eat dinner at because, you know, these people must be gourmet cooks.
But you do not know anything about what the size of their kitchen means unless you consider it in relation to the size of the rest of the house. If it is a if it is a big kitchen in a really big house. it is not telling you anything special, right, if it is a big kitchen in a small house, then that might be a place that you want to if you want to stay for dinner, because it is more likely that that kitchen is large for a special reason.
And so. The cerebral cortex of a human brain is not. In and of itself, special because of its size, however. There are some genetic changes that have happened in the human brain. As it is grown.
With to whatever size is typical for for the whole brain size, right, there are some changes that do give the human brain slightly more of some capacities.
they are not special, but there is just they just you know, we can do some things. Much better than other animals and, you know, correspondingly, other animals can do some things much better than we can not, we can not grow back limbs. We can not lift 50 times our own body weight. Well, I mean, maybe you can, but I can not live 50 ants without regard.
Very impressive. And then you are saying with the or the frontal cortex, like that is the size is not always the right measure of capability, I guess. So size is not everything.
Size is not everything. that is a quote. But, you know, people like it when I disagree. So let me disagree with you on something or just like play devil's advocate a little bit. So you have painted a really nice picture that evolution does not have a direction.
But is it possible if we just ran Earth over and over again, like this video game, that the final result would be the same? So in the sense that we are eventually there'll be an ajai type HAL 9000 type system that just like flies and colonizes nearby Earth like planets is always will be the same.
And and the different organisms and the different evolution of the brain, like it does not feel like it has like a direction. But given the constraints of Earth. And whatever this imperative, whatever the hell is running this universe like, it seems like it is. Running towards something, is it possible there will always be the same, thereby it will be a direction? Yeah, I think, you know, as you know better than anyone else, that the answer to that question is, of course, there is some probability that that could happen, right?
it is not a yes or no answer. it is what is the probability that that would happen? And there is a whole distribution of possibilities. So maybe we end up what is the probability we end up with exactly the same complement of creatures, including us? what is the likelihood that we end up with, you know. Creatures that are similar to humans that are but, you know, similar in certain ways, let us say, but not exactly humans or, you know, all the way to a completely different distribution of creatures situation, like if you were to bet money, what does that distribution look like if we ran Earth over?
So I would say, given the you are now asking me questions, that this is not science, this is not science.
So but I would say, OK, well, what is the probability that it is going to be a carbon life form? Probably high. Yeah, but that is because I do not know anything about. Really.
Yeah. You know, I do not I am not I am not really well versed that well. what is the probability that, you know, so what is the probability that the animals will begin in the ocean and crawl out onto land or the other way versus I would say probably high.
I do not know. But you know, but do I think what is the likelihood that we would end up with exactly the same or very similar? I think it is low, actually. I would not say it is low, but I would say it is not it is not 100 percent. And I am not even sure it is 50 percent. You know, I would say I do not think that we are here by accident because I think, like I said, there are constraints, like there are some physical constraints about Earth.
And of course, if you were a cosmologist, you could say, well, the the fact that the earth is if you were to do the big bang over again and keep doing it over and over and over again, would you still get the same solar systems? Would you still get the same planets? You know, would you still get the same galaxies, the same solar systems, the same planets? You know, I do not know. But my guess is probably not because there are random things that happen that can, again, send things in one, you know, make one set of trajectories possible in another set impossible.
So, um, but I, I guess my my my if I were going to bet something money or something valuable, I would probably say.
it is not zero and it is not 100 percent, and it is probably not even 50 percent, so there is some probability, but it will be similar. There would be similar.
But I do not think I just think there are too many degrees of freedom. There are too many degrees of freedom. I mean, one of the real tensions in writing this book is to on the one hand, there is some truth in saying. That humans are not. Special, we are just. You know, we are not special in the animal kingdom. All animals are well adapted. If they are survived, they are well adapted to their niche. It does happen to be the case that our niche is large for any individual human, your niches, whatever it is, but for the species.
Right.
We live almost everywhere, not everywhere, but almost everywhere on the planet. But not in the ocean, and actually other animals like bacteria, for example, have us beat miles, you know, hands down, right. So we are by any by any definition, we are not special. we are just, you know, adapted to our environment of bacteria, do not have a podcast. Exactly, exactly. So that is the tension, right. So on the one hand, you know, we are not special animals were just, you know, you know, particularly well adapted to our nation.
On the other hand, are niches huge? And we you know, we do not just adapt to our environment. We add to our environment. We make stuff up, give it a name, and then it becomes real. And so no other animal can do that. And so I think that the thing the way to think about it from my perspective or the way I made sense of it is to say you can look at any individual single characteristic that a human has.
That seems remarkable, and you can find that in some other animal. What you can not find in any other animal is all of those characteristics together. In a brain that is souped up in particular ways like ours is, and if you combine these things, multiple interacting causes, right? Not one, not one essence like your cortex, your big neocortex, but which is not really that big. I mean, it is just big for it, for your big brain, for the size, your big brain.
it is that it is the size it should be. If you add all those things together and they interact with each other, that produces some pretty remarkable results.
And if you are aware of that.
Then you can start asking different kinds of questions about what it means to be human and what kind of a human you want to be, and what kind of a world do you want to create for the next generation of humans?
I think that is the goal anyways, right, is just to just to have a glimpse of. Instead of thinking about things in in a simple, linear way, just to have a glimpse of the some of the things that matter, it seemed that evidence suggests matters to the kind of brain in the kind of bodies that we have. Once you know that, you can you can work with it a little bit.
You right. Words have power over your biology. Right now, I can text the words I love you from the United States to my close friend in Belgium. And even though she cannot hear my voice or see my face, I will change her heart rate, her breathing and her metabolism.
Either way, beautifully written.
Or someone could text something ambiguous to you, like, is your door locked? And odds are that it would affect your nervous system in an unpleasant way. So, I mean, there is a lot of stuff to talk about here.
But just one way to ask is. Why do you think words have so much power over our brain? Well, I think we just have to look at the anatomy of the brain to answer that question.
So if you look at the parts of the brain, the whole the the the systems that are important for processing language, you can see that some of these regions are also important for controlling your major organ systems and your like your autonomic nervous system that controls your cardiovascular system, your respiratory system and so on, that, you know, these regions control your endocrine system, your immune system and so on. So and you can actually see this in other animals, too.
So in birds, for example, the neurons that are responsible for birdsong also control the systems of a bird's body. And the reason why I bring that up is that the there is some scientists think that the anatomy of a of a bird's brain that control birdsong are homologous or structurally have a similar origin to the human system for a language.
So the parts of the brain that are important for processing language are not unique in and specialised for language. They do many things. And one of the things they do is control your major organ systems.
We can fall in love, have arguments about this all the time. Do you think we can fall in love based on words alone?
Well, I think people have been doing it for centuries. I mean, they used to be the case that people wrote letters to each other. Yeah. Um, you know, and then that was how they communicated. And I guess that is how you and Dan.
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.
So is the answer a clear yes there? Because I get a lot of pushback from people often that you need you need to touch and smell. And you know, the bodily stuff, I think the touch and the smell in the bodily stuff helps, OK, but I do not think it is necessary.
Do you think you are going to have a lifelong monogamous relationship with the A.I. system that only communicates with you on text romantic relationship? Well, I suppose that is an empirical question that has not been answered yet, but so I guess what I would say is. I do not think I could. Could any human could the average human could, you know, so so, um, if I. If I. I even I want to even I want to even modify that and say I am thinking now of.
Tom Hanks and the movie Castaway.
Yeah, you know, with Wilson, yeah, I think if if that was if you had to make that work, if you had to make that work for the volleyball. Yeah.
If you had to make it work, could you you could you. Prediction and simulation. Right. So if you had to make it work could you make it work using simulation and you know your past experience. Could you make it work. Could you make it work, you as a human, could you could you could you have could you have a relationship literally with an inanimate object and have it sustain you in the way that another human could? Yeah, your life would probably be shorter because you would not actually derive the body budgeting benefits from.
Right. So we have talked about, you know, how your brain it is most important job is to control your body. And you can describe that as your brain running a budget for your body. And there are metaphorical deposits and withdrawals into your body budget. And you also make deposits and withdrawals in other people's body budgets, figuratively speaking. So you would not have that particular benefit.
So your life would probably be shorter, but I think it would be harder for some people than for other people.
Yeah, I tend to my intuition is that you can have a deep, fulfilling relationship with a volleyball.
I think I think a lot of the. The environments are set up, I think that is a really good example, like the constraints. Now, of your particular environment, defined like I believe like scarcity is a good catalyst for deep, meaningful connection with other humans and with inanimate objects, so the less you have, the more fulfilling those relationships are. And I would say a relationship with a volleyball, the sex is not great, but everything else, I feel like it can be a very fulfilling relationship, which I do not know from an engineering perspective what to do with that.
And just like I said, it is an empirical question.
But but there are places to learn about that, right. So, for example, think about children and their blankets.
Right, so there there is something tactile and there is something olfactory and it is very comforting. I mean, even for even for non-human little animals, right, like puppies, and so I do not know about cats, but but cats are cold hearted.
there is no there is nothing going on there.
I do not know. There are some cats that are very dog like. I mean, really. So some cats identify as dogs. Yes, I think that is true.
Yeah. they are they are species fluid.
So you also write when it comes to human minds, variation is the norm. And what we call, quote, human nature is really many human natures. Again, many questions I can ask here, but maybe an interesting one to ask is I often hear, you know, we often hear this idea of be yourself. Is this possible to be yourself?
Is it a good idea to strive to be yourself? Is it does that even have any meaning?
it is a very Western question, first of all, because which self are you talking about? You do not have one self. There is no self that is an essence of you, you have multiple selves. Actually, there is research on this. You know, to quote the great social psychologist, Hazel Marcus, you are never you cannot be yourself by yourself. You you know, you.
And so different contexts pull for or draw on different features of your of who you are or what you are what you believe, what you feel, what your actions are.
A different context, you know, will put certain things or make more some features be more in the foreground and some in the background, it takes us back right to our discussion earlier about, um, Stalin and Hitler and so on.
The thing that I would caution, in addition to the fact that there is no single self, you know, that you have multiple selves who you can be.
And you can certainly choose the situations that you put yourself in to some extent, not everybody has complete choice, but everybody has a little bit of choice. And I think I said this to you before, that one of the pieces of advice that we gave Sophia, you know, when she went our daughter, when she was going off to college was. Try to spend time around people, choose relationships that allow you to be your best self. We should have said your best selves, but this, you know, the pool of cells, given the environment.
Yeah, but I get the one thing I do want to say is that the risk of saying be yourself, just be yourself, is that, um, that can be used as an excuse.
Well, this is just the way that I am. I am just like this and that I, I think should be tremendously resistant.
So that is one that is that is for the excuse. But, you know, I am really self-critical. Often I am full of doubt and people often tell me, just do not worry about it, just be yourself, man. And it is the thing is it almost it is not from an engineering perspective.
It does not seem like actionable advice because I guess constantly worrying about who.
What are the right? Words to say, to express how I am feeling is, I guess, my self, there is a kind of line, I guess, that it might be a Western idea, but something that feels genuine and something that feels not genuine.
And I am not sure what that means because I would like to be fully genuine and fully open. But I am also aware, like this morning, I was like very like silly and giddy.
I go, this is just being funny and relaxed and light, like there is nothing that could bother me in the world. I was just smiling and happy. And then I remember last night was just feeling like very grumpy, like like stuff was bothering me, like certain things were bothering me. And like, what are those are those are different selves. Like what? Who am I in that and what do I do? Because if you know, if take Twitter as an example, if I actually send a tweet last night and tweet this morning, it is going to be very two different people tweeting that.
And I do not know what to do with that, because one does seem to be more me than the other. But that is maybe because there is a nerd. The story that I am trying, there is something I am striving to be like the ultimate human that I might become. I have maybe a vision of that and I am trying to become that. But it it does seem like there is a lot of different minds in there. And they are all like like having a discussion and a battle of who is going to win, I suppose you could think of it that way.
But there is another way to think of it, I think, and that is that maybe the more Buddhist way to think of it. Right, or more contemplative way to think about it, which is not that you have multiple personalities inside your head, but you have your brain has this. Amazing capacity, it it has a population of experiences that you have had that it can regenerate, reconstitute, and it can even take bits and pieces of those experiences and combine them into something new.
And it is often doing this to predict what is going to happen next and to plan your actions. But it is also happening. This also happens just that is what mind wandering is, or just internal thought and so on, that it is the same mechanism, really. And so a lot of times we hear the saying, you know, just think if you think differently, you will feel differently.
But. Your brain is having a conversation continually with your body and your body, your brain's, you know, trying to control your body while trying, your brain is controlling your body. Your body is sending information back to the brain and in part the information that your body sends back to your brain. Just like the information coming from the world. Initiates the next volley of predictions or simulations. So in some ways, you could also say. The way that you feel your I think we talked before about affective feeling or mood coming from the sensations of body budgeting, you know, influences what you think.
And as much as so, feelings, influence, thought as much as I thought, influence, feeling and maybe more, but just the whole thing does not seem stable.
Well, it is a dynamic system, Mr. Engineer. Yeah, right. it is a dynamic. it is a dynamical system. Right. Nonlinear dynamical system. And I think that is a I am actually writing a paper with a bunch of engineers about them, about this, actually. But I mean, other people have talked about the brain as a dynamical system before.
But, you know, the real tricky bit is trying to figure out how do you get mental features out of that system. Like it is one thing to figure out how you get a motor movement out of that system. it is another thing to figure out how you get a mental feature, like a feeling of being loved or a feeling of being worthwhile or a feeling of, you know, just basically feeling like shit. How do you get a feeling, a mental mental features out of out of that system?
So I what I would say is that you are not the the Buddhist thing to say is that you are not one person and you are not many people. You are. You are the sum of your experiences and who you are in any given moment. Meaning what your actions will be is influenced by the state of your body and the state of the world that you have put yourself in, and you can change either of those things, one is a little easier to change than the other, right?
You can change your environment by literally getting up and moving, or you can change it by paying attention to some things differently and letting other some features come to the fore and other features be backgrounded like I am looking around your place. Oh, no. And I see something you should do. No, I am not.
But I am going to say one thing. Yeah. No green plants. No green plants, because green plants mean a home, and I want this to be temporary, fair, fair. But what is what is what goes through your mind when you see no green plants?
No, I am just making the point that.
What if you again, you know, not everybody has control over their environment. Some people do not have control over the noise or the temperature or, you know, any of those things. But everybody is a little bit of control and you can place things in your environment. Photographs, yes. Plants, anything that is meaningful to you and use it as a shift of environment when you need it. Yes, you can also do things to change the conditions of your body.
When you exercise every day, you are making an investment in your body. Actually, you are making an investment in your brain to it makes you even though it is unpleasant and you know, there is a cost to it. If you replenish, if you invest and you make up that you make a deposit and you make up that what you have spent, you are basically making an investment in making it easier for your brain to control your body in the future so you can make sure you are hydrated, drink water.
You do not have to drink bottled water. You can drink water from the tap. This is in most places, maybe not, you know, maybe not everywhere, but but most places in the developed world, you can try to get enough sleep. Not everybody has that luxury, but everybody can do something to make their, you know, body, but just a little more solvent. And that will also make it more likely that certain thoughts will emerge from that prediction machine.
Because I think that is the control you do have is. Yeah. Being able to control the environment. that is really well put on the I do not think we have talked about this. So let us go to the biggest unanswerable questions of consciousness.
What is he just roll your eyes. I did. That was my. Yeah. So what is consciousness from a neuroscience perspective? I know you.
I mean, I made notes, you know, because you gave me some questions in advance and I made notes for every single. Except that one.
Yeah, well, that one I had what the fuck.
And I took it out.
So there is something interesting because you are so pragmatic. Is there something interesting to say about intuition, building about consciousness, or is this something that we are just totally clueless about that this is let us focus on the the body. The brain listens to the body. The body speaks to the brain. And let us just figure this piece out and then consciousness will probably emerge somehow after that.
No, I think, you know well, first of all, it will just say up front, um, I am not a philosopher of consciousness and I am not a neuroscientist who focuses on consciousness. I mean, in some sense, I do study it because I study affect in mood. And that is that is the, um, uh, you know, to use the phrase that is the the hard question of consciousness.
How is it that your brain is modeling your body? Brain is modeling the sensory conditions of your body? it is, um, and it is being updated. That model is being updated by the census data that is coming from your body and it is happening continuously your whole life.
And you do not feel those sensations directly, you what you feel is a general sense of pleasantness or unpleasantness, comfort, discomfort, feeling worked up, feeling calm, so we call that affect. You know, most people call it mood.
So how is it that your brain gives you this very low dimensional feeling of mood or affect when it is presumably receiving a very high dimensional array of census data and the model that the brain is running of the body has to be high dimensional because there is a lot going on in there. Right? you are not aware.
But as you are sitting there quietly, as your listeners or our as our viewers are sitting there, might be working out, running now or as many of them right there, they are laying in bed smoking weed with their eyes closed.
And that is fair. So maybe we should say that bit again. So if so, some people may be working out. Some people may be relaxing, relaxing.
But, you know, even if you are sitting very still while you are watching this or listening to this, there is a whole drama going on inside your body that you are largely unaware of, yet your brain makes you. Aware. Or gives you a status report, in a sense, by virtue of these mental features, of feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant, feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable, feeling energetic, feeling tired and so on.
And so how the hell is it doing that? That is the basic question. Of of consciousness and like the status reports seem to be in the way we experience them seem to be quite simple, like. Well, it does not feel like there is a lot of data. Yeah, no, there is not. So when you feel. When you feel discomfort, when you are feeling basically like shit, you feel like shit, what does that tell you? Like what are you supposed to do next?
What caused it? I mean, the thing is not one thing caused it, right? it is multiple factors probably influencing your physical state, your body posture.
Very high dimensional. Yeah, very high dimensional. And that and the there are different temporal scales of influence. Right. So, you know, the state of your gut is not just influenced by what you ate five minutes ago. it is also what you ate a day ago and two days ago and and so on. So, um. So. I think. You know, when I am. I am not trying to weasel out of the question, I just think it is a it is.
The hardest question, actually, do you think we will ever understand it? Um, as a scientist, I think that we will understand it as well as we understand other things like the birth of the universe or the, you know, the nature of the of the universe, I guess I would say so.
Do I think we can get to that level of an explanation? I do, actually. But I think that we have to start asking somewhat different questions and approaching the science somewhat differently than we have in the past.
I mean, it is also possible that consciousness is much more difficult to understand than the nature of the universe. It is.
But I was not necessarily saying that it was a question that was of equivalent complexity. I was saying that I do think that we could get to. Some I am optimistic that I would not I would be very willing to invest my the time, my time on this Earth as a scientist in trying to answer that question, if I could do it the way that I want to do it, not in a way that is currently being done.
So, like rigourously. I did not want to say on rigourously, I just want to say that there are certain set of assumptions that, you know, scientists have what I would call ontological commitments, their commitments about the way the world is or the way that nature is. And they these commitments lead scientists sometimes blindly without they do not scientists sometimes sometimes scientists are aware of these commitments, but sometimes they are not. And these commitments on the less influence, how scientists ask questions, how what they measure, how they measure.
And I just have very different views then a lot of my colleagues about the ways to approach this. Not everybody, but but the way that I would approach it would be different and it would cost more and it would take longer. It does not fit very well into the current incentive structure of science. And so do I think that doing science the way science is currently done with the budget that it currently has and the incentive structure that it currently has, will we have an answer?
No, I think absolutely not. Good luck is what I would say.
People love book recommendations. Let me ask what, three books?
You can not just like you can not just give me three. I mean, like, really three what?
Seven and a half books you can come up. So you are also the author of Seven and a Half Lessons about Brain, your author of How Emotions Are Made.
OK, so definitely those are the top two recommendations of all the two greatest books of all time. Other than that, are there books that technical fiction and philosophical that you have enjoyed, you might recommend to others?
Yes, actually, you know, every PhD student, when they when they graduate with their Ph.D., I give them a set. I like a little library, like a set of books, you know, some of which they have already read, some of which I want them to read or but I think non-fiction books I would read, the things I would recommend are The Triple Helix by Richard Lewontin, the little book published in Two Thousand, which is, I think a really good introduction to complexity.
And, um. Population thinking as opposed to essentialism. So this idea essentialism is this idea that, you know, there is an essence to each person, whether it is a soul or your genes or what have you, as opposed to this idea that you we have the kind of nature that requires nurture.
We are we are you are the product of a complex dance between an environment, between a set of genes and environment that turned those genes on and off to produce your brain and your body and really who you are at any given moment title for that triple helix.
So playing on the double helix where it is just the biology is bigger than the biology.
Exactly. it is a wonderful book. I have read it probably six or seven times throughout the year. He has another book, too, which is. it is more I think scientists would find it, I do not know, I loved it, it is called biology is ideology and it really is all about I would not call it one of the best books of all time, but I love the book because it really does point out, you know, that science as it is currently practiced.
I mean, the book was written in nineteen ninety one, but it actually I think still holds that scientists, scientists currently practice has a set of ontological commitments which are somewhat problematic.
So the assumptions are limiting in ways that you it is, you know, it is like you are a fish in water and you do not like. OK, so yeah. So here it is possible. Yes. But you know but here is a here is a really cool thing I just learned recently.
Is it OK to go off on this tangent for a minute? Yeah. Yeah, that is great.
I was going to say that I just learned recently that we do not have water receptors on our skin. So how do you know when you are sweating? How do you know when when a raindrop, when you know when it is going to rain and, you know, like a raindrop hits your skin and you can feel that little drop of wetness. How is it that you feel that drop a witness when we do not have water receptors in our skin?
And I was when I was blown already?
Yeah, I that was my reaction to. Right. I was like, of course we do not because we evolved in the water.
Like, why would we need you know, it just it was just this like, you know, you have these moments where you are like, oh it is like, oh yeah.
So you will never see rain the same way again.
So the answer is it is a it is a it is a combination of temperature and touch, but it is a complex sense that is only computed in your brain.
there is no receptor for it anyways. Yeah.
that is why I like snow versus cold rain versus warm rain. All feel different because you are you are trying to infer stuff from the temperature and the size of the droplets is fascinating.
Your brain is a prediction machine. it is using lots and lots of information, combining it anyway. So but so biology is ideology is I would not say it is one of the greatest books of all time, but it is a it is a really useful book.
there is a book by if you are interested in psychology or the mind at all, there is a wonderful book a little it is a it is a fairly, fairly small book called Naming the Mind by Kurt Danziger, who is a historian of psychology.
Everybody in my lab reads both of these books.
So what was the book?
it is about the origin of where do where did we get the theory of mind that we have that the human mind is populated by thoughts and feelings and perceptions? And where did those categories come from? Because they do not exist in all cultures.
Also, this is not that is a cultural construct, the idea that you have thoughts and feelings and they are very distinct is definitely a cultural construct. it is another mind blowing thing, just like the rain. So Kurt Danzinger is about the opening chapter in that book is.
Absolutely mind blowing, I love it, I love it, I just think it is fantastic, and I would say that there are many, many popular science books that I could recommend that I think are extremely well written in their own way. You know, before I maybe I said this to you, but before I undertook writing how emotions are made, I read, I do not know, somewhere on the order of 50 or 60 popular science books to try to figure out how.
To write a popular science book, because while there are many books about writing, Stephen King has a great book writing on writing and you know, where he gives tips interlaced with his own personal history. That was where I learned you write for a specific person. You have a specific person in mind, and that is for me. That person is my is down there.
I mean, that is a whole nother conversation to have. Like which popular science books like what you learn from that search. It is. I have something for me, some popular science books I like.
I just roll my eyes like this is to me it is the same with Ted talks like some of them go too much into the flowery and do not I do not I would say do not give enough respect to the intelligence of the reader. And but that is what this is my own bias. I, I completely agree with you.
And in fact, I have a colleague. His name is Van Yáng, who, you know, he produced a cinematic lecture of how emotions are made that we wrote together with Joseph Fredman. No relation. Yes. Or we are all related. Really?
Well, I mean, you and I are probably, you know, some. Yeah, yeah.
But it is the memories are in there somewhere.
Yeah. From many, many, many generations ago.
Um, my half my family is Russian so from the good half the good everything but. You know, he wanted his goal actually is to produce. You know, videos and lectures that are beautiful and educational and that do not. do not dump the material down, and he is really remarkable at it, actually, I mean, just. But again, you know, that is that that requires a bit of a paradigm shift. We could have a whole conversation about the split between entertainment and education in this country and why it is the way it is.
But that is that is another conversation to be continued.
But I would say the if I were to pick one book that I think is a really good example of good science writing, it would be the beak of the finch.
Which one it won a Pulitzer Prize a number of years ago, and I am not I am I am not remembering the author's name, I am blanking.
But the I am guessing is that is it focusing on birds and the evolution of birds?
Actually, there is also the evolution of beauty. Yeah, yeah. Which is also a great book. But, you know, the peak of the finch is it is a. It it has two storylines that are interwoven. One is about Darwin and Darwin's explorations in the Galapagos Island and then modern day researchers from Princeton who have a research program in the Galapagos looking at Darwin's finches and. it is just a really first of all, there is top notch science in there and really science like, you know, evolutionary biology that a lot of people do not know and it is told really, really well, it sounds like they are also there is a narrative in there.
it is like storytelling, too. Yeah.
I think all good popular science books are are storytelling know, but storytelling grounded, constrained by, you know, the evidence.
And then I just want to say that there are for fiction, I am a really big fan of love stories just to return us to the topic that we began with.
And so my some of my favorite love stories are Major Pettigrew's last stand by. Helen Simons in. it is a it is a love story about people who you would not expect to fall in love and all the people around them who have to overcome their prejudices and end them. I love this book. What do you like, what makes a good love story? There is not one thing you know, there are many different things that make a good love story, but I think in this case you can feel you can feel the journey, you can feel the journey that these characters are on and all the people around them are on this journey to basically to come to grips with this really unexpected love, really profound love that develops between these two characters who are very unlikely to have fallen in love.
But they do. And. it is just it is very gentle, another book like that is the The Storied Life of A.J. Fear Key, which is also a love story. But in this case, it is a love story between a little girl and her adopted dad and the dad. Is this, like, real curmudgeonly, you know, guy. But of course, there is a story there and it is just a beautiful love story. And but it also it is like everybody in this community falls in love with him because he falls in love with her and he you know, she just gets left at his store.
His bookstore has this failing bookstore and he discovers that, you know, he feels like inexplicably, this need to take care of this little baby.
And this whole life emerges out of that one decision, which is really beautiful, actually very poignant.
Do you think the greatest stories have a happy ending or a heartbreak at the end?
that is such a Russian questions like Russian tragedies, you know, so I would say the answer to that for me, there is has to be heartbreak.
Yeah, I really do not like heartbreak. I do not like heartbreak. I want there to be a happy ending or at least. A hopeful ending, but the but, you know, like Doctor Zhivago, like or the English Patient.
Oh, my goodness. Like, why? Oh, it is just. Yeah, no.
Well, I do not think there is a better way to end it on a happy note like this, Lisa. Like I said, I am a huge fan of yours. Thank you for wasting yet more time with me talking again.

And now let me leave you with some words from Sun Tzu and the art of war. There are not more than five musical notes yet the combination of these five gives rise to more melodies that can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors yet in combination, they produce more hues that can ever be seen.
There are not more than five cardinal tastes, and yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
